# Introducing Pro Team: Simple, Affordable Site Licenses for Organizations and Universities

I'm excited to announce that our Pro Team plan is now available for organizations and universities everywhere. After years of work with public agencies, universities, and non-profit organizations, I've heard the same request over and over: make it simple to get 3DStreet Pro access for an entire team or classroom.

Today we made it happen -- for just $5,000 per year, your organization gets Pro access for up to 50 users with a straightforward activation process.

## Why Pro Team?

Over the past few years, I've worked with professionals and educators across a wide range of industries and locations who wanted to use 3DStreet with their teams but found individual subscriptions cumbersome. You told us you needed:

* **Simple activation** - No lengthy procurement processes or complex contracts
* **Domain-based access** - Automatic access for anyone with your organization's email domain
* **Predictable pricing** - One flat rate regardless of how many people use it (up to 50 users)
* **Self-service** - The ability to activate immediately without waiting for sales calls

Pro Team delivers on all of these.

## What's Included

Pro Team gives your entire organization (up to 50 users) access to all Pro features:

### All Pro Features for Your Team
* **Unlimited Geospatial Access** - Set locations anywhere in the world with Google 3D Tiles and satellite imagery
* **AI Generation Tokens** - Each user receives 100 monthly AI generation tokens for photorealistic renderings
* **GLB Import/Export** - Bring in custom 3D models from Blender and export scenes for professional applications
* **iOS and Android AR** - Share augmented reality scenes on any device
* **Clean Exports** - Download snapshots without watermarks for professional presentations
* **Custom AI Prompts** - Precise control over rendering style and atmosphere

### Hassle-Free Administration
* **Domain-Based Access** - Anyone with your organization or university email domain gets automatic Pro access
* **One-Year License** - Simple annual licensing with no auto-renewal surprises
* **Setup Support** - We'll help get your team onboarded within 2 weeks
* **Flexible Payment** - Pay by credit card for instant activation, or request an invoice

## Perfect for Universities

If you're a university faculty member or administrator, Pro Team is designed with you in mind. For many institutions, $5,000 is easier to approve than individual student subscriptions, and the domain-based access means students simply sign in with their university email to get Pro features.

**Educators**: Your students can explore geospatial features, create AI-powered visualizations, and design safer streets with professional tools. The one-year license gives you a full academic year (or more) to integrate 3DStreet into your curriculum.

**For K-12 educators**: We have a separate [classroom sponsorship program](/docs/classroom-sponsorship) specifically designed for primary and secondary schools with even more accessible options.
