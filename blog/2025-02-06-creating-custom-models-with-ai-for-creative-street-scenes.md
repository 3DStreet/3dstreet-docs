Have you ever found yourself designing a street scene and wishing you had that perfect 3D model to bring your vision to life? Whether it's a unique piece of street furniture, a local landmark, or even a toy car, traditional 3D modeling can be time-consuming and requires specialized skills. But what if you could turn any object into a 3D model with just a couple of photos and some AI magic? Let's explore how to do exactly that!

## The Power of AI-Generated 3D Models

Until recently, creating custom 3D models required extensive knowledge of 3D modeling software and hours of work. Now, thanks to advances in AI technology, tools like Microsoft's TRELLIS can transform simple photographs into usable 3D models in minutes. This opens up exciting possibilities for urban designers, planners, and anyone interested in creating more imaginative and personalized street scenes.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your 3D Model

### 1. Capture Your Reference Images

The quality of your 3D model starts with good reference photos. Here's what you need:
- Take 1-2 clear photos of your object from different angles
- Ensure good lighting and contrast
- A neutral background works best
- Include both front and side views when possible

### 2. Generate Your 3D Model with TRELLIS

Head over to [TRELLIS on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JeffreyXiang/TRELLIS) to start the conversion process:

1. Upload your reference photos
2. Click "Generate" and wait for the AI to work its magic
3. Review the preview to ensure it captures your object well
4. Click "Extract GLB" to download your 3D model

Pro tip: If you're feeling adventurous, you can also try [Hunyuan3D-2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tencent/Hunyuan3D-2), which allows you to generate 3D models directly from text descriptions!

### 3. Validate Your Model

Before proceeding, it's crucial to verify your model:
1. Visit [gltf-viewer.donmcurdy.com](https://gltf-viewer.donmcurdy.com)
2. Drag and drop your GLB file into the viewer
3. Confirm the model loads correctly and looks as expected

### 4. Optimize for Web Use

Your initial model might be larger than necessary. Here's how to optimize it:

1. Go to [OptimizeGLB.com](https://optimizeglb.com)
2. Upload your GLB file
3. Enable Draco compression (but avoid mesh simplification)
4. Click "Process All Files"
5. Right-click the "Download" button and copy the link address

This step not only reduces file size but also gives you a hosted URL for your model.

### 5. Import into 3DStreet

Finally, let's bring your model into 3DStreet:

1. Open your 3DStreet scene
2. Click "Add Layer" or "Custom Layers"
3. Select "GLTF Model from URL"
4. Paste your OptimizeGLB link
5. Adjust scale and position as needed

## Tips for Success

- Start with simple objects that have clear shapes and details
- Take photos in good lighting conditions
- Use the validation step to catch any issues early
- Consider the final size and scale in your street scene
- Keep backup copies of your original files

## Share Your Creations!
