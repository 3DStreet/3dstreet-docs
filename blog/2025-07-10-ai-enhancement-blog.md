# Enhance Your 3DStreet Scene with AI  
_A Simple Guide Using Flux Playground_

One of the most exciting ways to take your 3DStreet scenes to the next level is by enhancing them with the power of AI. Whether you're looking to add more realism, depth, or artistic flair, AI image tools offer a fast, intuitive way to transform your static render into a vibrant visual experience.

In this quick guide, we’ll walk you through how to use **Flux Playground** by Black Forest AI to enhance your 3DStreet scene.

## Step 1: Export Your Scene from 3DStreet

Start by designing your street in 3DStreet just as you normally would. Once you're satisfied with the layout, download a high-resolution **JPEG** image of the scene using the **share button**.

## Step 2: Upload to Flux Playground

Next, head to [Flux Playground](https://bfl.ai/models/flux-kontext). This is an easy-to-use AI-powered tool that lets you enhance and manipulate images through natural language prompts.

> 👉 You’ll need to create an account using your email address.

Once logged in, drag and drop your exported 3DStreet image into the canvas.

The interface will display your image, ready for enhancement.

## Step 3: Describe the Enhancements You Want

Use the prompt field to describe how you’d like the image to be modified. For example:

- _“Make the sky brighter and add more realistic lighting on the street.”_
- _“Add greenery and make the street look like it’s during golden hour.”_
- _“Make more photo realistic”_

Flux will interpret your prompt and generate a new version of your image based on your description.

## Step 4: Use the Fill Tool for Extra Detail

To refine your image further, use **Flux’s Fill tool**:

1. Select specific areas of the image to change—like an empty sidewalk or a blank building wall.
2. Enter a prompt such as _“add a bike ra
ck”_ or _“replace a blank wall with a mural.”_
3. Flux will generate edits that blend seamlessly into the rest of the scene.

Repeat as needed to bring more life and context into your design.

By combining the precision of 3DStreet’s modeling tools with the creative flexibility of AI image enhancement, you can quickly transform your designs into rich, immersive visuals that captivate stakeholders, students, or community members.

Whether you’re preparing a final presentation or just experimenting, tools like **Flux Playground** are a powerful way to make your 3DStreet scenes truly stand out.
