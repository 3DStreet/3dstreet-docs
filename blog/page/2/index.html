However, sometimes the most interesting places on Earth have the least availability of detailed 3D map tiles -- such as large parts of Africa and South America. Even for locations with detailed 3D tiles coverage, we&#x27;ve heard from users that sometimes the realism of the 3D tiles can distract from the focus of presenting proposed street projects.</p>
<p>In these cases, our new integration with Open Street Map (OSM) offers new dimensions to our mapping capabilities.</p>

new street intersection component for 3DStreet. This is a first version of a highly requested feature and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what the 3DStreet community can create.</p>
<p>In this post I&#x27;ll share how I got involved in 3DStreet, the features of the Intersection component, and what&#x27;s coming next!</p>
