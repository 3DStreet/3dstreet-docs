We're excited to announce the addition of several new open-source 3D models to the 3DStreet library, expanding our collection of urban furniture and street amenities. These new models, created by our team member Tyler, complement our existing library and provide even more options for creating detailed, realistic urban scenes.

Building on the success of our collaboration with the University of Oregon's I3 program, we've continued to develop our 3D model library to meet the evolving needs of urban planners, designers, and community advocates. These new models focus on the small but crucial elements that make our streets functional and livable.

Let's take a closer look at each of these new additions:

## Trash Bin
