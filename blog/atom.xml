<br>
<p>In this guide, we'll walk through the complete workflow to take a 3DStreet scene from simple 3D rendering to more realistic images and animations using Black Forest Labs (BFL) and Google's Veo3 Models.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-1-create-your-3d-street-scene">Step 1: Create Your 3D Street Scene<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/07/15/creating-photorealistic-pictures-and-animations-with-3dstreet-ai#step-1-create-your-3d-street-scene" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1: Create Your 3D Street Scene" title="Direct link to Step 1: Create Your 3D Street Scene">​</a></h2>
<p>First, let's create a 3D street scene like normal in 3DStreet. Whether you're starting from scratch or using a user-generated scene, make sure your layout captures the key elements of your street design vision.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Creating and editing a 3DStreet scene" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/step1-e4513ad7f645d38630ee90eb8771a3fc.jpg" width="800" height="450" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Once you're satisfied with your scene composition, it's time to export it for AI enhancement.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-2-export-a-clean-jpeg">Step 2: Export a Clean JPEG<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/07/15/creating-photorealistic-pictures-and-animations-with-3dstreet-ai#step-2-export-a-clean-jpeg" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 2: Export a Clean JPEG" title="Direct link to Step 2: Export a Clean JPEG">​</a></h2>
<p>Download a clean, high-resolution JPEG from your 3DStreet scene using the <strong>share button</strong>. This will serve as the foundation for our AI enhancement process.</p>
<br>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Exporting JPEG from 3DStreet" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/step2-a789dff7a9a435d80766becbb51f2b61.jpg" width="800" height="450" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<br>
<p>Capture the scene from an angle that best showcases your street design, as this will be the basis for all subsequent enhancements. Make sure to turn off the 3DStreet Logo and the Scene Title (this is a Pro feature) to create a clean export.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-3-import-to-black-forest-labs-for-photorealistic-enhancement">Step 3: Import to Black Forest Labs for Photorealistic Enhancement<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/07/15/creating-photorealistic-pictures-and-animations-with-3dstreet-ai#step-3-import-to-black-forest-labs-for-photorealistic-enhancement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 3: Import to Black Forest Labs for Photorealistic Enhancement" title="Direct link to Step 3: Import to Black Forest Labs for Photorealistic Enhancement">​</a></h2>
<p>Next, we'll import your screenshot into the <a href="https://playground.bfl.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Forest Labs Playground</a> to add photorealistic shading and lighting. This AI-powered tool will transform your basic 3D render into a more realistically shaded image.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot placeholder: Black Forest Labs interface - video timecode ~00:00:26" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/step3-cee9bc8f3ffc8cb20aae9ae20b658976.jpg" width="1706" height="664" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Upload your JPEG and for the Flux Kontext [pro] Model to work its magic. You can use a basic prompt like "add photorealistic shading and lighting" or add more details for specific styling changes if desired.</p>
<p>You'll get a couple different example outputs to choose from, each with its own interpretation of how to make your scene more photorealistic.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="output-before--after-comparison">Output Before &amp; After Comparison<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/07/15/creating-photorealistic-pictures-and-animations-with-3dstreet-ai#output-before--after-comparison" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Output Before &amp; After Comparison" title="Direct link to Output Before &amp; After Comparison">​</a></h3>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-4-use-the-fill-tool-for-structural-changes">Step 4: Use the Fill Tool for Structural Changes<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/07/15/creating-photorealistic-pictures-and-animations-with-3dstreet-ai#step-4-use-the-fill-tool-for-structural-changes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 4: Use the Fill Tool for Structural Changes" title="Direct link to Step 4: Use the Fill Tool for Structural Changes">​</a></h2>
<p>Another powerful feature from Black Forest Labs is the <strong>Fill tool</strong>, which allows you to modify specific parts of your scene. For example, you can change the structure of buildings to have something more realistic looking for suburban single-family homes.</p>
<p>Once you have a source image loaded from a previous enhancement, or directly from 3DStreet, and you're viewing it in full screen from the BFL Playground, click the three-dots in the lower-right-hand corner and then click "Fill".
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Click the Fill tool" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/step4a-a659355d819c5b36392b20be57722728.jpg" width="329" height="293" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>In Fill mode, click and drag to create a mask (or outlined area) to indicate the area in which you'd like to replace with new imagery.</p>
<br>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Using Fill tool to modify buildings" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/step4b-a4873f53c304040895335a33794936d1.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<br>
<p>Then, enter a prompt to automatically fill the area with whatever you desire, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacing generic buildings with more realistic architectural styles</li>
<li>Add detailed facades and realistic building materials</li>
<li>Modify landscaping and environmental elements</li>
<li>Enhance street infrastructure with realistic details</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example we used the prompt, "replace with suburban single family homes":</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Replacing default buildings with generates homes" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/step4c-e9f7bf373b1eaec031681fc3ac5055bb.jpg" width="1024" height="553" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<br>
<p>Now we've created a customized, high quality rendering ready for sharing with stakeholders.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-5-create-animation-with-googles-veo">Step 5: Create Animation with Google's Veo<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/07/15/creating-photorealistic-pictures-and-animations-with-3dstreet-ai#step-5-create-animation-with-googles-veo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 5: Create Animation with Google's Veo" title="Direct link to Step 5: Create Animation with Google's Veo">​</a></h2>
<p>We can take it one step further, by turning this enhanced static image into a dynamic animation! Take your photorealistic screenshot, right-click to download it, and load it into Google's Veo through <a href="https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Labs Flow</a>.</p>
<p>Open up the Flow tool, choose "Frames to Video", then upload your enhanced image, then choose that image as the first frame, then enter a prompt such as "Animate this suburban street scene."</p>
<br>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Google Veo interface" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/step5-8270e7e645732d470095dbb71f90f912.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<br>
<p>The system will take about a minute to generate your animation options.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-6-choose-your-animation-style">Step 6: Choose Your Animation Style<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/07/15/creating-photorealistic-pictures-and-animations-with-3dstreet-ai#step-6-choose-your-animation-style" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 6: Choose Your Animation Style" title="Direct link to Step 6: Choose Your Animation Style">​</a></h2>
<p>After processing, Google's Veo will show you a couple different animation options. Each will have its own interpretation of how to bring your street scene to life with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subtle camera movements</li>
<li>Environmental animations (trees swaying, etc.)</li>
<li>Lighting changes</li>
<li>Atmospheric effects</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Google Veo interface" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/step5b-a1b9989b6bfc76914755fccadc77b9b3.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>You can choose which ones you like best, or sometimes you'll need to adjust your prompt slightly to get an output that perfectly matches your vision.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tips-for-success">Tips for Success<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/07/15/creating-photorealistic-pictures-and-animations-with-3dstreet-ai#tips-for-success" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tips for Success" title="Direct link to Tips for Success">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start with a clear, well-composed 3DStreet scene</strong> - The quality of your final animation depends heavily on your initial composition</li>
<li><strong>Experiment with different prompts</strong> - Small changes in your description can yield dramatically different results</li>
<li><strong>Be patient with processing times</strong> - AI rendering can take a few minutes, but the results are worth the wait</li>
<li><strong>Save multiple versions</strong> - Keep copies of your work at each stage in case you want to try different approaches</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-results">The Results<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/07/15/creating-photorealistic-pictures-and-animations-with-3dstreet-ai#the-results" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Results" title="Direct link to The Results">​</a></h2>
<p>And there you go! You've successfully transformed a basic 3DStreet scene into a photorealistic, animated visualization that can effectively communicate your street design vision to stakeholders, community members, or anyone who needs to understand your proposed improvements.</p>
<p>This workflow opens up exciting possibilities for urban designers, planners, and advocates who want to create compelling visualizations without needing advanced 3D animation skills.</p>

<p>The new AI Assistant is here, and it's transforming how we create and modify street designs in 3DStreet! To help you hit the ground running with this powerful new feature, we've compiled a list of 10 essential prompts that showcase its capabilities and will help you optimize your design workflow right away.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="getting-started-with-ai-assistant-prompts">Getting Started with AI Assistant Prompts<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/05/29/10-prompts-to-try-with-the-new-ai-assistant#getting-started-with-ai-assistant-prompts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting Started with AI Assistant Prompts" title="Direct link to Getting Started with AI Assistant Prompts">​</a></h2>
<p>Following our <a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/05/22/introducing-ai-assistant-beta-your-creative-partner-for-street-design">recent announcement</a> of the AI Assistant beta, we've already seen users discovering creative ways to leverage this tool. These prompts range from simple shortcuts to complex design tasks – all made accessible through natural language commands.</p>
<p>Let's dive into the top 10 prompts you should try today:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-make-a-street">1. Make a Street<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/05/29/10-prompts-to-try-with-the-new-ai-assistant#1-make-a-street" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Make a Street" title="Direct link to 1. Make a Street">​</a></h2>
<p>The most fundamental prompt is also one of the most powerful. Simply click the "Create Street" button shortcut or type something like:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Create a street with two drive lanes, two sidewalks, and two bike lanes</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>This instantly generates the foundation of your scene, and you can easily modify these parameters before generation. It's the perfect way to kickstart any project without manually placing individual street elements.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-take-snapshots">2. Take Snapshots<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/05/29/10-prompts-to-try-with-the-new-ai-assistant#2-take-snapshots" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Take Snapshots" title="Direct link to 2. Take Snapshots">​</a></h2>
<p>Documentation and presentation are crucial parts of the design process. With the "Take Snapshots" button shortcut, the AI Assistant will capture three views of your scene:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your current perspective view</li>
<li>A bird's eye view from above</li>
<li>A head-on view of your street</li>
</ul>
<p>These images export directly as PNGs to your computer, making it effortless to share your vision or include in presentations.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-generate-report">3. Generate Report<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/05/29/10-prompts-to-try-with-the-new-ai-assistant#3-generate-report" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Generate Report" title="Direct link to 3. Generate Report">​</a></h2>
<p>Need to communicate the impact and purpose of your design? The "Generate Report" button shortcut prompts a form where you can specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current conditions</li>
<li>Problem statements</li>
<li>Proposed solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>The AI Assistant then creates a report and generates snapshots highlighting how your design addresses the specified challenges -– useful for stakeholder presentations or community engagement.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-insert-objects">4. Insert Objects<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/05/29/10-prompts-to-try-with-the-new-ai-assistant#4-insert-objects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4.

<p>At 3DStreet, our mission has always been to provide tools that empower anyone to rapidly prototype visions for improving our shared environment, starting with streets. The introduction of our AI Assistant marks a significant step toward making street design more accessible to everyone – from urban planning professionals to community advocates who may not be familiar with traditional 3D editing tools.</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p>With the new AI Assistant, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create complete street scenes</strong> from scratch using natural language descriptions</li>
<li><strong>Modify existing designs</strong> by simply explaining what you want to change</li>
<li><strong>Automate repetitive tasks</strong> that would normally require multiple manual steps</li>
<li><strong>Explore design alternatives</strong> quickly without needing to master complex editing tools</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-it-works">How It Works<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/05/22/introducing-ai-assistant-beta-your-creative-partner-for-street-design#how-it-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How It Works" title="Direct link to How It Works">​</a></h2>
<p>Using the AI Assistant is simple. Just click on the new "Assistant" icon at the bottom of the 3DStreet interface and start describing what you'd like to create or modify.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Create a two-way street with protected bike lanes and mature trees on both sides"</li>
<li>"Add a mid-block crosswalk with a pedestrian refuge island"</li>
<li>"Change the bike lanes to be at sidewalk level with planters as separation"</li>
<li>"Add outdoor seating areas in front of the cafes on the north side"</li>
</ul>
<p>The AI Assistant interprets your requests and performs the necessary operations to bring your descriptions to life, handling all the technical details behind the scenes.</p>

<p>We've heard from many users – especially those new to 3D design tools – that while they have clear visions for better streets, translating those ideas into 3D visualizations can be challenging. Creating even simple scenes often requires learning multiple interface elements and performing several discrete actions.</p>
<p>When we analyzed user behavior, we found it difficult to understand user intent through traditional analytics. Is someone moving around the scene because they're confused, happy with what they made, or looking for something specific? It's hard to tell.</p>
<p>By providing a natural language interface, we can:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Break down barriers</strong> to entry for non-technical users</li>
<li><strong>Better understand user needs</strong> through their natural language requests</li>
<li><strong>Provide an alternative UI</strong> for operations that can be challenging or repetitive when using the existing interface</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, it allows people to focus on the "what" of their street design rather than the "how" of the software.</p>

<p>The 3DStreet AI Assistant is powered by Google's Gemini LLM via its Vertex AI API and our custom React-based chat interface. The most useful part of the Assistant is its ability to call tools that perform actions in the 3DStreet Editor. These tools include entity placement, entity updates, street segment creation and modification, camera control, geospatial location updates and project information memory. When a tool is called, the interface will display a yellow notification while pending and resolve into a green or red notification depending on the result of the function call. You can click the function call notification to see the details of the function call.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Building the AI Assistant has helped us improve the underlying 3DStreet codebase. By creating clear function calls for the AI to use, we've had to improve our code structure and interfaces for a number of underlying features, especially street editing through our new <a href="https://3dstreet.org/docs/managed-street/overview-managed-street">Managed Street Format</a>.</p>

<p>A: Improved street geometry editing – especially better intersections support – continues to rank highly on our roadmap. Some users also share frustrations with elements of the 3DStreet user interface, especially new users. Providing simple interfaces for navigating and editing detailed scenes over a large 3D space is challenging. We hope the AI Assistant complements ongoing feature development by making existing features more accessible while we continue to develop more advanced capabilities. And sometimes developing UI for a new spatial feature is harder than developing the underlying code, making the AI Assistant a great option to introduce more experimental features.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="q-is-this-replacing-the-current-editing-interface">Q: Is this replacing the current editing interface?<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/05/22/introducing-ai-assistant-beta-your-creative-partner-for-street-design#q-is-this-replacing-the-current-editing-interface" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Q: Is this replacing the current editing interface?" title="Direct link to Q: Is this replacing the current editing interface?">​</a></h4>
<p>A: Not at all! The AI Assistant is an additional option that works alongside our traditional editing tools. Power users can continue using the full interface for precise control, while switching to the AI Assistant when it's more convenient.</p>

<p>The future of urban planning is happening right on our streets. In a recent webinar featuring 3DStreet founder Kieran Farr and InCitu's Nick, we explored how augmented reality (AR) is transforming community engagement with street design proposals.</p>

<p>Urban planning has long struggled with a fundamental problem: <strong>spatial communication is extremely difficult</strong>. When engineers present striping drawings or two-dimensional plans to community members, you can see the disconnect in people's eyes. Small business owners, residents, and stakeholders often can't visualize how proposed changes will impact their daily lives.</p>
<p>This information asymmetry between professionals and communities leads to predictable outcomes: projects lose political support, get watered down, face delays, or are canceled entirely.</p>

<p>The game-changer isn't using AR to display finished designs—it's using AR for <strong>rapid iteration at the earliest stages</strong>. Instead of spending significant time in AutoCAD before getting community feedback, planners can now create quick prototypes, test them on-site, and iterate based on real-world constraints.</p>

<p>Data alone doesn't change minds. When engaging with community members, statistics "roll off them like oil and water." The response to change is often emotional—people may intellectually understand that street safety is important, but they feel the loss of a parking space more acutely.</p>
<p>AR's power lies in <strong>turning fear of loss into collaborative opportunity</strong>. Instead of focusing on what's being taken away, these tools help communities envision positive alternatives: "You may be losing a parking space, but here's what you gain—and what would you like to gain?"</p>
<p>When people can see five new restaurant tables or beneficial rain gardens that prevent flooding, they start thinking: "I have agency to decide what could be there." This shift from loss aversion to collaborative visioning is where real change happens.</p>

<p>Both 3DStreet and InCitu offer free tiers for experimentation. The basic workflow is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a scene</strong> in 3DStreet with your target location</li>
<li><strong>Add and modify street elements</strong> using drag-and-drop tools</li>
<li><strong>Export as an <code>AR Ready</code> model</strong></li>
<li><strong>Import to InCitu</strong> for location-based AR deployment</li>
<li><strong>Test and iterate</strong> on-site, gathering community feedback</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important insight from practitioners? <strong>Start imperfect and iterate quickly</strong>. The goal isn't award-winning renderings—it's making spatial concepts tangible enough for meaningful community engagement.</p>
<p>As cities face mounting challenges around housing, climate change, and equity, tools that democratize urban design and accelerate community engagement aren't just nice to have—they're essential for building sustainable, inclusive neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Have you ever found yourself designing a street scene and wishing you had that perfect 3D model to bring your vision to life? Whether it's a unique piece of street furniture, a local landmark, or even a toy car, traditional 3D modeling can be time-consuming and requires specialized skills. But what if you could turn any object into a 3D model with just a couple of photos and some AI magic? Let's explore how to do exactly that!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-power-of-ai-generated-3d-models">The Power of AI-Generated 3D Models<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/02/06/creating-custom-models-with-ai-for-creative-street-scenes#the-power-of-ai-generated-3d-models" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Power of AI-Generated 3D Models" title="Direct link to The Power of AI-Generated 3D Models">​</a></h2>

<p>One of the most exciting new features we've been working on is adding a number of custom blending options for 3D map layers. To enable this, use the new Blending option in the Geospatial Layers panel, then choose your desired Blend Mode.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/ui-geo-blending-c556a0fcb5940b9068185672f9d19f5e.jpg" width="948" height="586" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="environment-settings">Environment Settings<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2025/01/31/new-feature-roundup-map-layer-blending-and-environment-settings#environment-settings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Environment Settings" title="Direct link to Environment Settings">​</a></h2>
<p>A common request is changing background and colorization of the environment in 3DStreet scenes. This is now possible with the new Environment Settings panel. Choose from presets including day, night, sunny morning, cloudy afternoon, and more. Or choose the color preset to select a custom background color.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/ui-environment-selector-8d2201dedf2e87009fb8ab11fd6dc35c.jpg" width="942" height="591" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>By combining blending and custom background colors you can create a huge range of creative interpretations for your scenes. Here's an example using the Dark blending mode and adjusting a custom background color:</p>
<mux-player player-software-name="mux-player-react" player-software-version="2.5.0" stream-type="on-demand" primary-color="#FFFFFF" secondary-color="#000000" accent-color="#653CB0" autoplay="muted" loop=""></mux-player>

<p>When you double-click on an object in the viewport or in the layers panel, you'll notice a brief focus animation as the camera zooms into the focused object. The new Focus Animation Speed selector allows you to adjust the speed of the animation which can make it more suitable for creating quick videos and sharing. The focus animation is a simple way to add fly through effects to your scenes when sharing live or when recording with screen capture software. Click Viewer &gt; Focus animation &gt; Speed &gt; slow to slow down the animation.</p>

<p>The city's main arteries, particularly the Dodoma-Morogoro Road, currently reflect the growing pains of this urban transformation. The road serves multiple functions as it traverses urban, rural and regional landscapes, requiring careful design consideration to accommodate various user demands while maintaining principles of sustainability and connectivity.</p>
<p>Today, this vital corridor operates as a two-lane arterial road accommodating a diverse mix of traffic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motorcycles and tuk-tuks (bajaji)</li>
<li>Private cars and vans</li>
<li>Light and heavy commercial vehicles</li>
<li>Public transportation buses</li>
</ul>
<p>While the current infrastructure technically supports both walking and cycling, it predominantly caters to motorized travel - creating challenges for sustainable urban mobility.</p>

<p>Our team worked with key stakeholders including Tanzania National Roads Agency (TANROADS), Tanzania Rural and Urban Roads Agency (TARURA), Land Transport Regulatory Authority (LATRA) and Dodoma City Council (DCC) to explore treatments that would better support regional infrastructure needs.</p>
<p>As analysts entering the workforce, our background in civil engineering was very limited compared to some of our tenured colleagues and professional partners, making it challenging to convert traditional engineering drawings into visualizations that we could then leverage for our work with stakeholders. That's when we discovered 3DStreet, which allowed us to rapidly prototype different scenarios from the foundational engineering work of our professional staff and partners.</p>
<p>Using 3DStreet's prototyping capabilities, we created digital twins of both existing conditions and proposed changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A six-lane dual carriageway with 2 dedicated public transport lanes for busses</li>
<li>Two-lane service roads on both sides for local access</li>
<li>Wide, shaded walkways and cycleways for non-motorized transport</li>
<li>Integration with adjacent land use to support sustainable urban development</li>
</ul>

<p>We found the ability to instantly transform cross-sections designed in Streetmix to interactive 3D visualizations with satellite map layers in 3DStreet to be transformative to understanding the true impacts and benefits of the proposed project in context with the existing environment.</p>
<p>Also, using a combination of 3DStreet and Mapillary’s street view imagery to create a before and after first-person perspective was particularly impactful - it helped both our team and our local partners understand how the proposed changes would affect the actual experience of using the street. Being able to visualize the separation between modes and the scale of proposed facilities made the benefits much more tangible.</p>
<p>By combining all the elements of 3D GIS data and Street elements from 3DStreet combined with the use of real-world ground truth from Mapillary imagery, we were able to create a very effective video visualization of the project background and potential future scenarios.</p>

<p>Located in the central Pacific Ocean, Kiritimati Island faces unique challenges as climate change reshapes the region. While the island's current population numbers only a few thousand, it may soon need to accommodate more residents from Kiribati’s other island which is increasingly vulnerable to rising sea levels.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Global and local map of Kiritimati Island" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/kiritimati-global-map-d88ef03bc93701e4f6f600e18b075f46.jpg" width="1200" height="685" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>The island's main road network currently reflects its small population and historic development patterns. The existing infrastructure is basic, with limited provisions for pedestrians, cyclists, or public transport. As we look toward a future where Kiritimati could play a crucial role in regional climate migration, these roads will need to evolve to serve a larger, more diverse population.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Current road conditions from Mapillary" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/existing-conditions-kiritimati-london-28def4afcd3379667815e0e80fcc1f02.jpg" width="1200" height="683" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The current road infrastructure supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private vehicles, motorcycles, and cargo trucks</li>
<li>Limited pedestrian movement</li>
<li>Basic access to key facilities and settlements</li>
<li>Connection between main population centers like London Town and Banana</li>
</ul>

<p>Working with key stakeholders including local government authorities and the <a href="https://irap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Road Assessment Program</a>, the team explored design solutions that would create safer, more inclusive streets while preparing for potential population growth.</p>
<p>Using 3DStreet's visualization capabilities, we created digital twins of both current conditions and proposed improvements across three critical areas that represent the diverse needs of transportation infrastructure on the island.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Project areas of focus" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/local-aerial-map-kiritimati-a104ed8352e425131a339b7361584413.jpg" width="800" height="455" class="img_ev3q">

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reimagining-street-space">Reimagining Street Space<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/12/15/visualizing-climate-resilient-infrastructure-kiritimati-sustainable-streets#reimagining-street-space" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reimagining Street Space" title="Direct link to Reimagining Street Space">​</a></h2>
<p>Proposed designs incorporate several key features to support sustainable mobility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wider, shaded walkways to protect pedestrians from the tropical sun</li>
<li>Slow speed zones in urban areas that safely mix vehicles, motorcycles, and bicycles</li>
<li>Dedicated bus bays to support future public transport services</li>
<li>Enhanced safety features based on iRAP assessment recommendations</li>
</ul>

<p>By combining Mapillary's street-level imagery with 3DStreet's visualization tools, we were able to create compelling before-and-after comparisons that helped stakeholders understand the tangible benefits of the proposed changes. This approach was particularly valuable given the unique context of planning for both current needs and potential future scenarios.</p>
<p>The visualization process helped demonstrate how relatively modest infrastructure improvements could significantly enhance safety and accessibility while building climate resilience. These visualizations are proving instrumental in making the case for infrastructure funding that considers not just today's needs, but tomorrow's challenges.</p>

<p>The Kiritimati project pushed our platform in exciting new directions. While 3DStreet was originally designed for visualizing individual street segments, the World Bank team's requirements encouraged us to significantly expand our capabilities. The project's scope required handling multiple kilometers of roadway across three distinct sections, driving us to optimize our rendering pipeline while maintaining detail.</p>
<p>Creating locally appropriate assets and smooth fly-through animations that transition between current and proposed conditions required new approaches to both asset development and camera control. These technical challenges led to innovations in scene management and rendering that have since become standard features in our platform, benefiting visualization projects worldwide.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="looking-forward">Looking Forward<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/12/15/visualizing-climate-resilient-infrastructure-kiritimati-sustainable-streets#looking-forward" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Looking Forward" title="Direct link to Looking Forward">​</a></h2>
<p>As climate change continues to impact Pacific island nations, the importance of forward-thinking infrastructure planning becomes increasingly critical. Through this project, we're demonstrating how digital twin technology can help communities like Kiritimati prepare for complex demographic and environmental changes while improving quality of life for current residents.</p>
<p>The visualizations we've created are helping stakeholders understand how streets can be transformed from basic transport corridors into vibrant, safe spaces that support sustainable mobility for all users. As we continue to refine these designs, we're excited to see how this approach could serve as a model for other islands facing similar challenges across the Pacific region.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>High resolution 3D map tiles have become a popular choice for adding immersive local context to 3DStreet scenes. However, sometimes the most interesting places on Earth have the least availability of detailed 3D map tiles -- such as large parts of Africa and South America. Even for locations with detailed 3D tiles coverage, we've heard from users that sometimes the realism of the 3D tiles can distract from the focus of presenting proposed street projects.</p>
<p>In these cases, our new integration with Open Street Map (OSM) offers new dimensions to our mapping capabilities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Open Street Map Integration Screenshot of San Francisco City Hall" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/open-street-map-integration-sf-city-hall-ff93419ac7bfad69485ea73d4bdb640a.jpg" width="1920" height="1086" class="img_ev3q">

<p>3DStreet now offers integration with Open Street Map (OSM) as a new Geospatial Layer map source. This integration provides 2D political map ground tiles and 2.5D buildings through OSM GeoJSON buildings data. This feature is now available for all Geospatial Pro Plan users in addition to the existing map data providers Google Maps 3D Tiles and Mapbox 2D Satellite Maps.</p>

<p>Integrating OSM with 3DStreet continues our commitment to open-source collaboration. A key advantage of the OSM approach is that it allows you to leverage the existing OSM community and resources, ensuring that the data remains up-to-date and accessible to all. The 3DStreet integration today is "read only" and relies on existing OSM data, but <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contribute_map_data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users wishing to update map data can do so through a variety of tools from the OSM ecosystem</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to Open Street Map 2D ground tiles, the new OSM integration provides basic building geometry through GeoJSON OSM data sources. The basic building footprints provide just enough context in most cases for locals to understand the location of a proposed project, while not distracting from the focus on the proposed project itself.</p>
<p>This GeoJSON parser also opens the door to future integration of alternative geospatial data sources, although today this only supports closed polygons for buildings.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-frame-component-for-osm-integration">A-Frame Component for OSM Integration<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/10/25/announcing-open-street-map-and-3dstreet-integration#a-frame-component-for-osm-integration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A-Frame Component for OSM Integration" title="Direct link to A-Frame Component for OSM Integration">​</a></h2>
<p>Similar to our other integrations, we've chosen to "build in the open" by contributing improvements to an existing A-Frame <code>OSM4VR</code> component designed by anonymous community member <code>ctrlw</code>.</p>
<p>You can view the original A-Frame component by <em>ctrlw</em> here <a href="https://github.com/ctrlw/osm4vr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/ctrlw/osm4vr</a> and <a href="https://github.com/3dstreet/osm4vr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out the 3DStreet version here</a> which adds webpack support to better handle dependencies as well as custom features to allow for integration with the 3DStreet Editor app. Like all parts of 3DStreet, we welcome community contributions to this component and others.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, we're excited about the potential to support custom tiles. In addition to the political map, we aim to move beyond this basic OSM implementation and support private servers and alternate tile types. Our ultimate goal is to allow users to specify which tile type they prefer, providing even greater flexibility and customization.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance 3DStreet's mapping capabilities and explore new ways to empower our users to reimagine public spaces.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I’m Tyler Riedell, a fourth-year product design student at the University of Oregon. This past summer, I had the privilege of collaborating with the incredibly talented team at 3DStreet to release several open-source street safety and sidewalk prop models.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/corner-island-de23bc117fb19ff9e61f2b20468d9892.jpg" width="1319" height="990" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/10/04/new-placemaking-and-street-safety-3D-models#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>I got involved with this project through my ongoing work with Dr. Marc Schlossberg at the University of Oregon, where I’ve been assisting him in exploring how Augmented Reality can improve street safety in Eugene, Oregon. This experience has given me the opportunity to merge my passion for design with city planning and street safety, topics I never thought I’d be involved in.</p>
<p>This whole experience has been transformative for me, especially in sharpening my 3D modeling skills. As a product designer, I’m used to working with highly detailed models, often with enormous file sizes. But for the models I created to function on mobile AR platforms, I had to rewire how I approached 3D design. When Dr. Schlossberg initially told me to create models with the smallest polycount possible —- without losing their identity —- I was at a bit of a loss on where to begin.</p>
<p>Working with Dr. Schlossberg and team of graphics professionals from 3DStreet like Kieran Farr and GnanaSai Reddy pushed me to expand my knowledge of low-poly model design and the associated pipeline for preparing 3D assets for high performance real-time XR applications -- an area I knew little about before this project. I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with such experienced individuals, and I’m proud of how much I’ve learned throughout the process.</p>

<p>Working alongside Dr. Schlossberg, Kieran Farr, and the team at 3DStreet has been an incredible experience, and I’m truly grateful for the opportunity to learn from such talented professionals. As I look ahead, I’m excited to embark on my next adventure in the design world—ideally with a design consultancy in Portland, Oregon—where I hope to collaborate with another group of creative, driven designers and continue growing both personally and professionally.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My name is Sam Rothstein and I’m happy to share my work on a new street intersection component for 3DStreet. This is a first version of a highly requested feature and I'm looking forward to seeing what the 3DStreet community can create.</p>
<p>In this post I'll share how I got involved in 3DStreet, the features of the Intersection component, and what's coming next!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/default-intersection-efd2ce7f27beeb8c1e901ea447d804ab.jpeg" width="1161" height="730" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I started my career working for <a href="https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cesium on CesiumJS</a>, helping hundreds of developers build bespoke applications around global-scale geospatial data. It was through this open-source 3D work that I met Kieran from 3DStreet and shared his vision of a world where everyone was empowered to reimagine their neighborhood.</p>
<p>I was inspired to help contribute as an open-source developer and use my background in web-based 3D rendering and full stack engineering to bring the project forward.</p>
<p>Many 3DStreet users have been asking for support for visualizing intersections in their neighborhoods. It turns out, <a href="https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/tech/map/geometry/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intersections are hard</a>! So we decided to start with something simple: the goal for this initial component was to create a simple yet versatile interface for connecting multiple streets. The component includes options for adding curbs, sidewalks, crosswalks, stop signs, and traffic signals. We made this available in the 3DStreet API for other developers in June 2022, but it wasn’t until now – 2 years later – that the user interface and editor capabilities of 3DStreet have finally caught up to make this available for people to use without writing code.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick overview of the capabilities:</p>

<p>We call this release Early Access for a reason -- 3DStreet Intersections need more work and we need your help to prioritize what needs improvement. Do we need better geometry? Curb ramps? Better interface to edit the intersection? We'd appreciate ideas and suggestions on how to help you visualize your perfect intersections.</p>

<p>I’m honored to be a contributor to the first iteration of a critical component of 3DStreet. Since my 3DStreet contribution, my career has propelled me to new roles including autonomous vehicle data visualization and a new announcement coming soon -- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srothst1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow me on LinkedIn for the latest!</a> I’m excited to see how people use this component to change the world!</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open-source 3D traffic safety device models as a result of a collaboration with the University of Oregon’s Incubating Interdisciplinary Initiatives (I3) 2023 award program]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm Luke Walker, a recent graduate of the Immersive Media Communications Master's program from the University of Oregon and I'm proud to share the open-source release of 3D traffic safety device models as a result of a collaboration with the <a href="https://environment.uoregon.edu/latest-i3-seed-funding-cycle-supports-new-projects-city-planning-and-immersive-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Oregon’s Incubating Interdisciplinary Initiatives (I3) 2023 award program for "Developing Augmented Reality (AR) Visualization Tools to Increase Sustainable Transportation."</a></p>
<p>The I3 program fosters new research projects across disciplines, in this case communications &amp; planning -- advised by Dr. Danny Pimentel in UO's School of Journalism and Communication, Dr. Marc Schlossberg in UO's School of Planning, Public Policy and Management with 3DStreet serving as an outside technical partner.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/uo-ped-safety-part1-439a0acb90ff68c04bcaa1695c47f50f.jpg" width="1785" height="854" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>One of the goals of the collaboration was to use Augmented Reality (AR) communication tools to visualize street redesigns for sustainability. During the prototype process I was tasked with finding ways to visually represent pedestrian and micro-mobility improvements in AR and was pleased to have found 3DStreet and its rich library of urban planning prototype models.</p>
<p>While 3DStreet's library of open-source urban 3D models was a great starting point, our project needed custom safety 3D models that were not available in 3DStreet to support Dr. Schlossberg's project goals. We partnered with the 3DStreet team on best-practices for low-polygon realtime 3D modeling on mobile devices with limited processing power for mobile Augmented Reality visualization.</p>
<p>I created these models in Maya and worked with 3DStreet modeling expert <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0121c5733ab653a5c6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GnanaSai Reddy</a> for conversion to glTF (source) and glb (distribution) for use in the 3DStreet app and to empower future open-source community use and remixing.</p>

<code>Dividers &amp; Traffic Control: street-element-crosswalk-raised</code></p>
<p>Raised crosswalks reduce vehicle speeds and provide a safer environment for pedestrian crossing. The height of this 3d model allows users to see the elevated crosswalk clearly in Augmented Reality to understand the effect a raised crosswalk could have on an intersection or street crossing.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="traffic-circle">Traffic Circle<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/07/15/open-sourcing-3d-traffic-safety-objects-with-university-of-oregon-i3-program#traffic-circle" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Traffic Circle" title="Direct link to Traffic Circle">​</a></h2>

<code>Dividers &amp; Traffic Control: street-element-traffic-island</code></p>
<p>The traffic island, circle, or roundabout forces the flow of traffic to move in one direction. Focusing traffic to exit the roundabout from just one direction, instead of three, simplifies the pedestrian and driver visual environment and interaction. This object was created to be used for smaller residential or larger multi lane streets and can be scaled depending on the need.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="median-refuge-island">Median Refuge Island<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/07/15/open-sourcing-3d-traffic-safety-objects-with-university-of-oregon-i3-program#median-refuge-island" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Median Refuge Island" title="Direct link to Median Refuge Island">​</a></h2>

<code>Dividers &amp; Traffic Control: street-element-traffic-island-end-rounded</code></p>
<p>The traffic islands were created to be used as a refuge island for crossings, providing a safe place for pedestrians to stand on a street while reducing their danger from vehicles. Visualizing a refuge island in AR allows users to see they have the same protection on the island as they would on a sidewalk.</p>

<code>Dividers &amp; Traffic Control: street-element-sign-warning-ped-rrfb</code></p>
<p>Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFBs) are used as visual cues for drivers that pedestrians are crossing the road at a crosswalk. City planners utilize RRFBs regularly for crosswalks needing multilane crossings. I made this object to replace the standard crosswalk signs with no flashing lights so individuals viewing it in AR could see how the placement of an RRFB would be helpful to promote a safer crossing environment.</p>

<code>Dividers &amp; Traffic Control: street-element-speed-hump</code></p>
<p>The speed hump, or bump, is used to promote slow traffic speeds on low volume, low speed roads.</p>

        <updated>2024-06-25T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're excited to share new 3DStreet features funded by our first cohort of paid users.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A heartfelt thanks to our intrepid group of first customers of 3DStreet Geospatial Pro since our <a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/06/14/announcing-3dstreet-geospatial-pro">launch 11 days ago</a>. We’re honored by your support of a product still in the making, and to give thanks back we’d like to share these newly released features that you have directly funded and requested.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/visitacion-3dtiles-street-slope-36ddd159bf45f0e357bef2781c549065.jpg" width="1470" height="1041" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>A shared theme of your feedback is that 3DStreet has been a big help for your projects – from feasibility to visualization for stakeholders and creating new designs – however we need to improve its usability, especially for new users.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-baby-toolbar">New Baby Toolbar<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/06/25/geospatial-pro-launch-feature-early-access#new-baby-toolbar" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Baby Toolbar" title="Direct link to New Baby Toolbar">​</a></h2>
<p>We’re proud to share our new baby toolbar: clocking in at 3 options, it’s a small but mighty one that we expect to grow quickly with your feedback and support. The toolbar is intended to help prevent “accidental selection and moves” where – during an attempt to move the camera view – a user unintentionally selects and moves an object. With no undo, this is a pain.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/baby-toolbar-d3c0fa0bb845e640ee1e51a15704be20.jpg" width="363" height="195" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>There are 3 toolbar options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pointer - click to select and move an object</li>
<li>Hand - a mode that prevents selection or moving objects, you can only click to move the view (press <code>shift</code> while clicking to rotate the view)</li>
<li>New Object - clicking + will show the Add New Entity panel to add objects, smart layers, and more</li>
</ul>
<p>While we work on undo, using the Hand mode is the safest way to browse a scene without making unintended changes.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="many-more-improvements-based-on-your-project-requirements-and-direct-feedback">Many more improvements based on your project requirements and direct feedback:<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/06/25/geospatial-pro-launch-feature-early-access#many-more-improvements-based-on-your-project-requirements-and-direct-feedback" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Many more improvements based on your project requirements and direct feedback:" title="Direct link to Many more improvements based on your project requirements and direct feedback:">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>No more remix - the concept of remix was confusing so we have removed it. Now you can simply “Save” or “Save as…”</li>
<li>Bigger scenes – we now support scene sizes up to about 3 miles / 5km. (Previously the skybox was too small, so we made it bigger.)</li>
<li>Fixing bugs – sometimes 3d tiles wouldn’t load so we fixed one of those cases, and sometimes the red and blue bounding box of your selected object was too large and didn't take into account rotation, so we fixed that too.</li>
<li>New scene – Pro users now have “New Scene” which allows you to start from scratch and create a new geolocated scene</li>
<li>Simplification of rotation controls – when placing streets and objects most users appear to be rotating around the vertical ‘y’ axis. Therefore we updated the default rotation transform controls (accessed by pressing ‘e’ keyboard shortcut) to only allow rotation on that axis:

<p>San Francisco’s Mission Bay neighborhood is one of the fastest growing areas in the City. From 2010-2020, it doubled its population by hosting many of SF’s new residential building projects. [1] [2] Mission Bay is also host to well-known firms like OpenAI, Uber, and UCSF, not to mention world-class entertainment facilities like the newly built Chase Center, home of the Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>But there’s one glaring omission in Mission Bay – there are no schools. “There currently are no elementary, middle, or high schools, public or private, in the Mission Bay area,” said Matt Haney in 2017, then President of the Board for SF public schools. “This is unacceptable. This is a community that urgently deserves and needs a school.” [3]</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/mission-bay-es-empty-site-03bc0f97c4b0e92642f35bcb6a03dc23.jpg" width="1268" height="667" class="img_ev3q"><br><i>
The future site for an elementary school building in Mission Bay, San Francisco is currently a parking lot sitting on top of rocky fill covering what was once part of an actual bay and tidal wetlands. [4]</i></p>
<p>25 years after being proposed in a 1998 Mission Bay redevelopment plan, construction on a school in the neighborhood has finally begun! The $90 million Mission Bay Elementary School project is expected to be completed in time to open for the school year starting August 2025. [5]</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-neighborhood-old-school-transportation">New Neighborhood, Old School Transportation<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/05/24/community-led-design-of-safe-school-streets-for-mission-bay-elementary-school#new-neighborhood-old-school-transportation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Neighborhood, Old School Transportation" title="Direct link to New Neighborhood, Old School Transportation">​</a></h2>
<p>Despite its recent development, Mission Bay was designed with no protected active transportation facilities aside from bayside trails. Many of its streets consist of 3 lanes dedicated to motor vehicles in each direction (2 travel, 1 parking) with no separated bike lanes, few painted ones, and copious sharrows. While effective in accommodating egress vehicle traffic after Warriors and Giants games, existing street space does not promote active mobility for neighborhood residents and school children.</p>

<i>Owens Street meets Nelson Rising Lanes in Mission Bay, San Francisco. The parcel northeast of the intersection (currently occupied by a parking lot) is the future site of the proposed SFUSD Mission Bay Elementary School.</i></p>
<p>Local community members are excited about the prospect of improving street conditions to encourage active walking, biking and mobility for students living in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>“Mission Bay is a densely populated, flat neighborhood, so it just makes sense to provide active mobility options for students going to school. But we are faced with a built environment that prioritizes the car and makes walking and cycling a scary proposition for parents,” said Peter Belden, a community activist and San Francisco’s 2024 Bike Champion of the Year.</p>

<p>However, community leaders were disappointed with the limited resources dedicated to improving street safety ahead of construction of the new school. While the City committed to fund a study [6] to identify problem areas and suggest possible designs for a few trouble spots, it fell short of community expectations by not delivering a comprehensive, neighborhood-wide plan for safe walking and biking access to the school.</p>
<p>The community took it upon themselves to create their own designs. “We started by rethinking the traffic circle neighboring the new school and originally designed to accommodate peak vehicle flows after ball games. With a school going in next door, we wanted to re-imagine it as best-in-class infrastructure that separates modes, providing a safety buffer for vulnerable road users while allowing residents to access nature and planned affordable housing without the need for a car,” explained Nik Kaestner, the former Director of Sustainability at SFUSD.</p>

<p>“We were inspired by ‘Dutch-style’ roundabouts [7] with full separation continuing through the intersection, not only along approaching streets,” continued Kaestner. “But we were limited in our ability to convert our vision from hand-drawn sketches into a practical prototype that would excite fellow advocates and be taken seriously by City staff.”</p>

<p>Community leaders turned to 3DStreet for help in converting the sketch into a 3D prototype that can be used  in advocacy and planning conversations with City staff and elected officials.</p>
<p>This simplified “digital twin” encompasses a virtual representation of both the existing conditions and proposed future changes. Hosting on 3DStreet Cloud allowed the team to create visuals for specific use-cases on demand and share these with others to further remix.</p>

<p>To provide visual context for stakeholders reviewing proposed changes, community leaders added real-world surface scan maps and a 3D model of the proposed elementary school using 3DStreet’s Geospatial Pro features.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/mission-bay-traffic-circle-rev4-298a0ace3bdfeb768fe7c0d4535b4a0e.jpg" width="1080" height="611" class="img_ev3q"><br>
<i>Adding the Mapbox satellite map ground layer along with a low fidelity 3D model of the school building helped ground the visualization in the present-day context.</i></p>
<p>Leveraging multiple camera perspectives, especially simulating a first-person view, was especially helpful to share critical design attributes with stakeholders.</p>
<p>“As our neighborhood develops a vision for how we will welcome the Mission Bay school, this tool is a great gift to outreach and engagement with both elected officials and agency staff. The multi-viewpoint visualization, especially the first-person animation of traffic circle usage at a child’s height and the before/after slider bar feature clearly convey what is possible.” said Sarah Bertram, a local community member advocating on behalf of neighboring residents.</p>

<p>This project is just starting. The school has broken ground with more than a year of construction remaining. While the prototypes of safer school streets are winning people’s hearts, the constraints of budget and technical feasibility are the next issues to tackle for community and City stakeholders.</p>
<p>Fortunately, 3DStreet gives stakeholders a head start as they consider more detailed civil plans. “3DStreet’s ability to export to other popular file formats allowed us to jumpstart the manual process of preparing baseline conditions so that our valuable engineer time can be better spent on project-specific requirements,” said Jorge Romero-Lozano, a civil engineer and executive director of GreeningProjects.org, who also consulted on the project.</p>

<p>Over the past 6 months I've met hundreds of folks across the transportation and planning industry – from city planners and city and state transportation officials to local community activists, NGOs, private engineering consultants and many more.</p>
<p>Hundreds of meetings later, a clear trend has emerged from these conversations: The rising force of "Community-led Planning" – empowering local community members to envision and advocate for changes to their streets and public spaces. However, there are significant challenges preventing this from becoming mainstream practice.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-challenge---negative-trust-spiral">The Challenge - Negative Trust Spiral<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/04/22/community-led-planning-trends-at-caltrans-equity-advisory-committee#the-challenge---negative-trust-spiral" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Challenge - Negative Trust Spiral" title="Direct link to The Challenge - Negative Trust Spiral">​</a></h2>
<p>The core issue, as articulated by practitioners worldwide, is that it's very difficult for most people to imagine changes to their streets. This leads to a negative feedback loop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects face pushback from the community because they don't understand the proposed changes</li>
<li>This results in delays, watered-down designs, or even outright cancellations</li>
<li>Trust erodes between the agency and community</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/slide-challenge-negative-trust-spiral-current-conditions-street-planning-projects-1dc5cebcd64eca88e345c10e93a7a890.jpg" width="960" height="540" class="img_ev3q">
<strong>Community engagement is often treated as a point-in-time exercise rather than a continuous process.</strong></p>
<p>Forward-thinking communities are trying to change this by making community feedback an integral, ongoing part of the planning process. Crucially, project ideas originate from the community itself, which then collaborates with the appropriate agency to refine the design to serve local needs.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="addressing-agencycommunity-asymmetry">Addressing Agency/Community Asymmetry<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/04/22/community-led-planning-trends-at-caltrans-equity-advisory-committee#addressing-agencycommunity-asymmetry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Addressing Agency/Community Asymmetry" title="Direct link to Addressing Agency/Community Asymmetry">​</a></h2>
<p>Underlying this dynamic is a major knowledge asymmetry between transportation professionals and the general public when it comes to street design.</p>
<p>To enable meaningful community participation we need to level the playing field – to lift up community members from out of the informational asymmetry crevasse. One way to do this is through a simple, shared visual language to understand the geospatial relationships and design constraints of their streets. This is the key problem we're working to solve at 3DStreet, along with other industry partners <a href="https://about.streetmix.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streetmix.net</a>, <a href="https://www.incitu.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inCitu</a>, <a href="https://streetplan.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StreetPlan.net</a>, and the <a href="https://hackmd.io/legG6QzVREKTsiTSxUS2zA?view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSM Pedestrian Working Group</a>.</p>
<p>This emerging ecosystem of no/low cost tools allow anyone to quickly prototype street designs, transforming 2D diagrams into interactive 3D models. Early case studies show the power of this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycNIaqczyv0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In Manchester, CA, the city engineer used 3DStreet to clearly communicate parking tradeoffs for a Main Street redesign, a top concern for local businesses</a></li>
<li><a href="https://studio.youtube.com/video/m393-ZNeU68/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NGOs like Transport Oakland are training their members to create compelling visuals for advocacy using these tools on group workshop calls</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Historically, 3D modeling, urban planning and civil engineering required expensive proprietary software. But with the consumerization of augmented reality and open-source tools like 3DStreet combined with widely-deployed WebXR and geospatial standards, these capabilities are now accessible to all. While much work remains to make them truly user-friendly, the potential to revolutionize community engagement is tremendous.</p>
<p>By equipping residents with the tools to express their vision, while educating them about real-world constraints, we can build trust, understanding and consensus between communities and transportation agencies. This is the promise of community-led planning – and it's a future we're excited to build together.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>"Geospatial" is the uniting theme for the many feature requests we get from 3DStreet's growing user base. Users&nbsp;can already place custom street scenes, so it's natural to understand why geospatial features like 3D Google Map Tiles or Augmented Reality visualization keep coming up in conversations with users when we <a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/01/30/creating-augmented-reality-ar-scenes-with-streetmix-3dstreet-adobe-aero">explore common repeatable workflows for visualizing safer infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p>To kick off 2024 we've been doing some experiments to see how these technologies could be applied to public streets and spatial design.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/3d-tiles-3dstreet-aa3921b202e721e8fb32544a6f6f4f6d.jpeg" width="1024" height="886" class="img_ev3q">

<p>When presenting street improvements projects, leveraging the existing environment provides instantaneous context and understanding for stakeholders of all ages and abilities. Even low fidelity representations of the surrounding environment helps viewers recognize a project's location and orientation.</p>
<p>This experiment is a first step to adding 3D maps as a new feature to 3DStreet Editor.</p>

<p>This demo resonated well with users -- <a href="https://twitter.com/3dstreetapp/status/1768310079307272423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our first tweet sharing the concept</a> was retweeted 11 times and liked more than 50 times on Twitter and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/3dstreet_threejs-activity-7174079008819560449-kzqw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attracted engaging comments on LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>Users would like 3D Map Tiles productized as a built-in feature of 3DStreet, but unfortunately the Google 3D Tiles API is significantly more expensive than traditional 2D map tiles starting at <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/aframe-loader-3dtiles-component?tab=readme-ov-file#using-google-3d-tiles-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$6 per 1000 unique user sessions</a>. In order to offer this feature we will need to come up with a paid subscription plan option to cover the costs of Google Maps 3D Tiles access.</p>

<p>The recent <a href="https://dreamxr.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamXR hackathon</a> in San Francisco was the perfect environment to work alongside other XR developers for inspiration to finish a new app in 48 hours. We created BOLLARD BUDDY AR -- an app that lets you place traffic control devices anywhere using augmented reality!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="video-demo-1">Video Demo<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/03/25/dev-blog-geospatial-and-augmented-reality-feature-research#video-demo-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Video Demo" title="Direct link to Video Demo">​</a></h3>
<p>It's easiest to show with a video:</p>

<p>The app is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press PLAY to start the AR view after scanning a QR code*</li>
<li>Then tap to place cones or other objects at the yellow cursor.</li>
<li>Choose between a few different traffic safety device models from the 3DStreet model library</li>
</ul>
<p>While cool, it is technically "table stakes" within the scope of AR app demos. But what's next makes it more useful.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="geospatial-qr-hack-for-fake-vps">Geospatial QR hack for fake VPS<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/03/25/dev-blog-geospatial-and-augmented-reality-feature-research#geospatial-qr-hack-for-fake-vps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Geospatial QR hack for fake VPS" title="Direct link to Geospatial QR hack for fake VPS">​</a></h3>
<p>What makes BOLLARD BUDDY AR app unique compared to other AR "tap to place" demos is the connection to a specific location -- a longitude and latitude is embedded in the app QR code so that any objects placed in the scene can be localized relative to that longitude and latitude origin point.</p>
<p>This is extremely effective as a cheap and easy way to have a perfect "virtual positioning system" (or VPS) as long as the person posting the sign is capable of posting the sign at the very specific longitude and latitude (and orientation) associated with the QR code. This is easier than it sounds -- by simply dropping a pin on Apple or Google Maps at a clearly identifiable landmark such as a parking meter or telephone pole at a sufficient zoom level you can get a very precise longitude and latitude.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="create-and-share-from-mobile----serverless-with-no-auth">Create and share from mobile -- serverless with no auth<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/03/25/dev-blog-geospatial-and-augmented-reality-feature-research#create-and-share-from-mobile----serverless-with-no-auth" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Create and share from mobile -- serverless with no auth" title="Direct link to Create and share from mobile -- serverless with no auth">​</a></h3>
<p>The other unique BOLLARD BUDDY AR feature is sharing your newly created augmented reality street scene with other users (and even yourself) to refer to in the future.</p>
<p>Outside in the bright sun on the hot tarmac we don't want to challenge users with authentication or collecting data that requires keyboard input. How can we allow people to share a complicated geospatial scene without a server or authentication?</p>
<p>Our trick was to stuff the newly created scene data in the URL as url-encoded data. More specifically, a JSON representation of the array of 3D A-Frame entities and for each their mixin, position, rotation properties are all <a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/JSONCrush" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crushed</a> and placed as a querystring value in a new "Share URL".</p>
<p>Then we use the native OS share dialog to allow the user to choose how they want to share this, from copy/paste to sending message, email, AirDrop (my favorite) or more.</p>

<p>I've always been excited about the fun factor of AR and VR headsets, but recent technology advances in everyday smart phones means that the same tech is possible without a headset leveraging built-in AR libraries such as ARKit and ARCore on Apple and Android devices respectively.</p>
<p>The magic of these AR libraries is precision -- they have extremely accurate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)</a> available out-of-the-box for native apps usable on almost any device you may have in your pocket.</p>
<p>Until now these libraries have only been available for native applications, but recently web JavaScript-based access was made available on Android through WebXR AR Mode bindings. iOS devices using Safari have not yet supported WebXR AR Mode, however recently there have been a few "polyfill" workarounds. We are using <a href="https://launch.variant3d.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variant Launch</a> which provides a (nearly) seamless experience for iOS users to instantly launch web-based AR apps. Behind the scenes, Variant Launch uses Apple's iOS "App Clips" feature to the underlying ARKit library through the WebXR JavaScript standard without needing to download an app first.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reaction-and-productization-1">Reaction and productization<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/03/25/dev-blog-geospatial-and-augmented-reality-feature-research#reaction-and-productization-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reaction and productization" title="Direct link to Reaction and productization">​</a></h3>
<p>People often show surprise when using the app for the first time -- perhaps from the fun of reconfiguring public space for the first time, or the magic of discovering a super power they didn't realize their smart phone supported.</p>
<p>Some users see past the initial "Wow Moment" to practical use cases, especially for professional field measurement and planning for traffic control device placement or other civil engineering-related purpose. In fact, once users start placing basic cones provided in the default application it's not long before they start thinking of other objects they'd like to place and additional use cases.</p>
<p>We've continued development of this app concept, most recently adding new objects and improving usability and trying it out with real users at a street fair in San Francisco Saturday March 23.</p>

<p>Greetings! I'm Marc Schlossberg, and I've been working alongside <a href="https://journalism.uoregon.edu/directory/faculty-and-staff/all/pimend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Danny Pimentel</a> and graduate student <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-walker-439b78119/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Walker</a> at the University of Oregon on an exciting project: crafting augmented reality (AR) landscapes for our streets. What I have here is a practical, step-by-step guide designed to walk you through how to bring this innovative vision to your own neighborhood. So, let's roll up our sleeves and get our hands digitally dirty!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="getting-started-measuring-and-designing">Getting Started: Measuring and Designing<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/01/30/creating-augmented-reality-ar-scenes-with-streetmix-3dstreet-adobe-aero#getting-started-measuring-and-designing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting Started: Measuring and Designing" title="Direct link to Getting Started: Measuring and Designing">​</a></h2>

<p>To kick things off, you need to know how wide your street is. This is more straightforward than it sounds: just pop over to Google Street View or use an aerial photo, and get an approximate measurement. It's okay if it's not pinpoint accurate — we just need a ballpark figure.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting Your Street: Easy as Pie with Streetmix</strong></p>
<p>Once you've got your measurements, it's time to jump onto Streetmix—a free, user-friendly online tool that lets you reimagine that street space to your heart's content. Want to add bike lanes, benches, or green spaces? Simply drag and drop the elements you want to include, adjusting the widths to fit your street’s dimensions. Here’s where your creativity shines!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/J7eHGPI8MA57Pyzgsd8i-41.61-d8f2c4d7d54a990318659f4ac3f4bdbc.png" width="640" height="360" class="img_ev3q">For my project, I took a standard residential street and turned it into a car-free park, a delightful haven for community gatherings. Imagine that — but on your block! Feel free to start with the street I made - Demo St.: <a href="https://streetmix.net/schlossb/20/demo-st" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://streetmix.net/schlossb/20/demo-st</a></p>

<p>With your design all set in Streetmix, it's time to give it a touch of 3D flair. 3DStreet is a fantastic plugin that lets you visualize your newly designed street in all its three-dimensional glory. Explore your virtual environment, tweak and tune each element until you’re satisfied. It's a mini-adventure in urban planning from the comfort of your screen! You can go straight to my Demo St. in 3DStreet as well: <a href="https://3dstreet.app/#https://streetmix.net/schlossb/20/demo-st" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://3dstreet.app/#https://streetmix.net/schlossb/20/demo-st</a></p>
<p><strong>Trimming the Excess for AR</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/IkXMBseXhrpqImEJSANN-73.23-6ef8699ad042fd310f99859136492bb0.png" width="640" height="360" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>To prep for AR, you'll want to peel away the layers that aren’t needed—like buildings, to keep things neat. After simplifying, you can then export your model directly into a format that's ready for the world of augmented reality.</p>
<p>To delete a layer, select the layer in the left-hand panel -- such as "Buildings &amp; Blocks Container" in the screenshot above -- then press the <code>delete</code> key and click <code>ok</code>. This will remove buildings and grounds from lots that are not needed for our AR project.</p>

Here, you can manipulate your 3D model to perfection. However, remember this is purely optional—the process is meant to be quick and streamlined.</p>

<p>Alright, now to the magical part—transferring your 3D model to an augmented reality software. I personally use <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/aero.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Aero</a>, thanks to the site license at the university, but there are other AR apps you can explore. This step allows you to add animations and make your scene come alive, although again, this step is not necessary for the "quick and dirty" path.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/tSVcvVL1kH92J4F4ALF8-112.94-b8f411524c96f6c05320da8bb061eba1.png" width="640" height="360" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>AR software opens with an empty workspace and, at least in Aero, you can simply drag and drop your 3D file onto the workspace and the whole thing magically appears. In many ways it will look exactly like it did in 3DStreet.</p>
<p><strong>Geolocation: Pinning It to the Real World</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/M5vycvy2ClFbSLnLm6FY-133.23-1df718f2655ad0733ab2392a4b55bf57.png" width="640" height="360" class="img_ev3q">What’s truly remarkable with software like Adobe Aero is the ability to anchor your AR scene to a precise location on Earth. While this grounds your creation to a specific spot, it's not mandatory; you can always opt to apply your scene freely to any street you wish.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/sZPPzIEDdoKCLolneDd8-145.05-2b18a10c24f8055f5cf44db93afee86e.png" width="640" height="360" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Once your AR scene is polished and ready, you create a shareable link through Adobe Aero. Anyone with this link can open it on their mobile device, head to the designated street, and behold—your digital transformation materializes before their eyes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Your street is transformed into your scene that you can actually walk through and see what it would look like on your street, and you can go forward, backward, see all the different things that you've done, and really start to reimagine, well, what would this street look like if it wasn't a street as has been, but is actually a park, a place for people in this particular example?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://3dstreet.org/assets/images/XP1Nfq1sugGz8zrILMJb-179.54-ef26283fc536ad6544d4f738185a220f.png" width="164" height="360" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>To illustrate, envision wandering through the park that was once just a plain street—all through the magic of AR. Moving forward or backward, the entire scene is interactive and truly a game-changer for community engagement and urban design.</p>

<p>And there you have it—a dynamic overview of transforming streets with AR using some clever tools and a pinch of imagination. Not so intimidating now, right? With mostly free resources and a little bit of time, you can be on your way to designing, exploring, and sharing augmented realities that could pave the way for how we perceive and utilize our shared spaces.</p>
<p>Until next time, happy designing and thanks for joining me on this digital adventure. Bye for now!</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A spotlight on the contributions to 3DStreet from the software development team at Zade.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2023 marks a significant year for 3DStreet, made possible through our <a href="https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talented community of contributors</a> both volunteer and paid. <a href="https://zade.agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zade Agency</a> fits in the latter category as a software development team for-hire based in Ukraine. Over the past year Zade emerged as a major boost to our development productivity and I wanted to share how their contributions have helped 3DStreet in a critical time for the organization.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-challenge-for-3dstreet">The Challenge for 3DStreet<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/01/29/partner-spotlight-zade#the-challenge-for-3dstreet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Challenge for 3DStreet" title="Direct link to The Challenge for 3DStreet">​</a></h3>
<p>To meet our timeline for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnjtUW4J8uc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public beta launch of 3DStreet Editor in 2023</a>, we faced several challenges. A primary concern was the gap in React expertise among our existing development team. While we are skilled in various aspects, existing React knowledge was crucial for implementing deep and rapid modifications to <a href="https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet-editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3DStreet Editor</a> which is a heavily modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A-Frame inspector</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, as a <a href="https://www.3dstreet.org/docs/about-3dstreet/3dstreet-llc-entity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self-funded project</a> we have very real budgetary constraints making it imperative to optimize every resource.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="zades-solution-to-boost-react-development">Zade's Solution to Boost React Development<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/01/29/partner-spotlight-zade#zades-solution-to-boost-react-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Zade's Solution to Boost React Development" title="Direct link to Zade's Solution to Boost React Development">​</a></h3>
<p>We found Zade through a direct personal referral via our designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daria-dombrovska-933902207/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daria Dombrovska</a>. Zade immediately brought a wealth of React knowledge through their team of both senior and junior engineers, filling the crucial skill gap in our team.</p>
<p>As a self-trained software developer myself, I worked directly with a senior engineer at the beginning to confirm our architectural approaches and details of our tech stack. I also worked with our account manager to agree on the use of <a href="https://github.com/orgs/3DStreet/projects/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Projects, issues, and PRs</a> to manage our working relationship.</p>
<p>For day-to-day tasks I create <a href="https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet-editor/issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub issues</a> that are prioritized in <a href="https://github.com/orgs/3DStreet/projects/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Projects</a> and tackled via a junior engineer who is mentored by the experienced staff. Even as a junior engineer, they have way more experience in React fundamentals than I do given my <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22aframevr%22%20(from%3Akfarr)&amp;f=live" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rather myopic focus on A-Frame and three.js development</a> over the past decade.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2023-highlight-launching-3dstreet-cloud">2023 Highlight: Launching 3DStreet Cloud<a href="https://3dstreet.org/blog/2024/01/29/partner-spotlight-zade#2023-highlight-launching-3dstreet-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2023 Highlight: Launching 3DStreet Cloud" title="Direct link to 2023 Highlight: Launching 3DStreet Cloud">​</a></h3>
<p>One of the most notable achievements in 2023 was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnjtUW4J8uc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launch of 3DStreet Cloud</a>, a React application using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase Firestore</a> on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Cloud Platform</a>.</p>
<p>3DStreet Cloud is the foundation of the growth engine of the <a href="https://3dstreet.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3DStreet Editor product</a> -- it is the system that allows our users to collaborate on safe street designs and fulfill our core mission.</p>
