With 3DStreet\'s enhanced AR capabilities and AI tools like World Labs, you can now create immersive augmented reality experiences that let people walk through history. I recently used this workflow to create AR scenes of historic San Francisco for a [Green Density walking tour](https://actionnetwork.org/events/concrete-jungle-or-urban-paradise-the-green-density-walking-tour), allowing participants to toggle between past and present views of the same location.\\n\\n## What You\'ll Create\\n\\nThis tutorial will walk you through the complete process I used to create AR experiences for my Green Density walking tour, where participants could scan QR codes and see how San Francisco\'s landscape has evolved over time.\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\nBy the end of this tutorial, you\'ll have:\\n- Transformed historic photos into 360\xb0 panoramic scenes using World Labs\\n- Created geospatially-positioned AR scenes in 3DStreet\\n- Generated QR codes for easy sharing with tour participants\\n- Built an engaging community experience that brings history to life\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Step 1: Find and Prepare Your Historic Photo\\n\\nStart by finding a historic photograph of your location. In this case I used a photo from early 1900s that I found on a [local San Francisco history website](https://www.foundsf.org/A_Brief_History_of_Cesar_Chavez/Army_Street).\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n  <img\\n    width=\\"50%\\"\\n    src=\\"/images/2025-08-13/Armyatharrison-19311.jpg\\"\\n  />\\n<br/>\\n<i>This is a 1931 photo from San Francisco\'s Mission district looking west at a newly constructed street with streetcar rails and a new below ground combined sewer system.</i>\\n\\n\\nSometimes, your historic photo may need improvement. Here\'s another photo of the same area 50 years earlier in 1882. The visual quality is much poorer and we\'ll need to do some work to improve it.\\n\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n  <img\\n    width=\\"50%\\"\\n    src=\\"/images/2025-08-13/opensfhistory_wnp33.04069.jpg\\"\\n  />\\n<br/>\\n<i>This is an 1882 photo looking south toward Bernal Heights with a footbridge over Pecita Creek visible on the lower right.</i>\\n\\n### Enhancing Source Image Quality (Optional)\\n\\nThese days there\'s more than just Photoshop with new AI-powered options to restore source images.\\n\\n#### **Option 1: Flux Kontext Pro**\\nAs [covered in a recent blog post tutorial](/blog/2025/07/15/creating-photorealistic-pictures-and-animations-with-3dstreet-ai), I strongly recommend the Black Forest Labs Flux Kontext Pro model for AI powered image editing that retains original geometric dimensions. This is perfect for a case like this where we want to retain topography and structure geometry but reshade nearly everything.\\n\\n#### **Option 2: Flux Inpainting (Fill)**\\n- Use tools like the Fill or Inpainting function in [Black Forest Labs playground](https://playground.bfl.ai/) to edit specific areas\\n- Great for replacing empty areas with historically accurate details\\n- I used this to better illustrate the historic Precita Creek area\\n\\n#### **Option 3: OpenAI GPT Image Model**\\nChatGPT has image-to-image editing features that create high quality outputs, but the model does not retain accurate geometric information from the source image. This is fine for artistic interpretation -- while it has high quality output, it comes at the expense of frequent hallucination\\n\\n#### **My Enhanced Precita Creek (Flat) Image**\\n  <img\\n    width=\\"50%\\"\\n    src=\\"/images/2025-08-13/bernal-edited2.jpg\\"\\n  />\\n<br/>\\n<i>This is the enhanced version of the 1882 photo that has deeper topography shading and a fill-generated creek featuring reflective water along the original gulch path from the source image.</i>\\n\\n## Step 2: Create a 360\xb0 Scene with World Labs\\n\\nOnce you have your enhanced historic photo, it\'s time to create a full panoramic environment.\\n\\n1. **Import to World Labs**: Upload your modified photo to [World Labs](https://www.worldlabs.ai/) (early access required)\\n2. **Generate 3D Scene**: The AI will expand your 2D image into a full 360\xb0 environment\\n3. **Export Panoramic Image**: Download the resulting equirectangular (panoramic) image\\n\\n![](https://kfarr.github.io/ar-tour-assets/panoramic/v1-flux-world-inpaint-export_1754604606182.jpg)\\n<i>This is the output after importing the 2D image and generating the 3D scene using World Labs, then exported as a panoramic 360\xba equirectangular projected image.</i>\\n\\n### Panoramic Image Enhancement for Topography Matching\\n\\nThe newly generated panoramic image won\'t be perfect -- the AI will not be able to match actual topography for the outpainted areas. Luckily, World Labs has a tool for panoramic inpainting that makes it much easier to target specific areas of the horizon to modify the topography to match the actual land area in the location of your historic photo.\\n\\n![](https://kfarr.github.io/ar-tour-assets/panoramic/v2-flux-world-inpaint-export_1754605882755.jpg)\\n<i>This panoramic image has been modified with World Labs inpainting to add hills in the rough location of Twin Peaks as well as the distant bay and a small island representing Yerba Buena.</i>\\n\\n## Step 3: Host Your Panoramic Image\\n\\nYou\'ll need your panoramic image(s) to be publicly accessible via URL:\\n\\n1. **Upload to GitHub Pages**: Create a new repository and upload your image\\n2. **Alternative Hosting**: Use any publicly accessible web hosting service\\n3. **Get Direct URL**: Copy the direct link to your image file\\n\\nI created a [GitHub repository for these AR source and output materials](https://github.com/kfarr/ar-tour-assets). \\n\\n## Step 4: Create Your 3DStreet AR Scene\\n\\nNow comes the exciting part - building your AR scene in 3DStreet.\\n\\nYou can also Clone an existing 3DStreet scene that already has the below configuration and simply replace the location and image Src values. [Here is a known-working panoramic AR 3DStreet project that you can Save as... to modify for your own project.](https://3dstreet.app/#/scenes/def34103-d69c-49f9-94b4-2f8c657f8af6)\\n\\n### Setting Up the Basic Scene\\n\\n1. **Create New Scene**: Start a new project in 3DStreet\\n2. **Set Geospatial Location**: \\n   - Click the location icon and enter the real-world coordinates\\n   - This anchors your AR experience to the physical location\\n\\n### Adding the Panoramic Skybox\\n\\n1. **Add Custom Geometry**:\\n   - Start by adding a circle geometry\\n   - Click \\"Advanced\\" and change geometry type to \\"sphere\\"\\n   - Change the Radius value to `150`\\n\\n2. **Apply Your Historic Image**:\\n   - With this custom geometry selected, in \\"Advanced\\" section\\n   - Open the Materials tab\\n   - Select the `Src` value and replace with the URL of your panoramic image\\n   - Press enter\\n   - Change `Shader` to `flat`\\n   - Change `Side` to `back`\\n   - Scroll back up to the common controls and change `Scale` `x` value to -1\\n\\n3. **Adjust Orientation**:\\n   - Fine-tune the Y rotation to align the view correctly\\n   - Use the red axis of orientation indicator in the center of your scene to identify North\\n\\n### Configure AR Viewer Mode\\n\\n1. **Select Viewer Mode**: Click `Viewer` layer and fine `Mode` in the right sidepanel\\n2. **Enable WebXR-AR**: Set the viewer `Mode` to `webxr-ar`\\n3. **iOS Support**: Enable iOS support (requires 3DStreet Pro plan)\\n4. **Generate QR Code**: Click to generate and download the QR code (You must save or Save as... your scene to generate a QR code)\\n\\n## Step 5: Test Your AR Experience\\n\\n<div style={{float: \'right\', width: \'50%\', maxWidth: \'300px\', marginLeft: \'20px\', marginBottom: \'20px\'}}>\\n  <MuxPlayer\\n      streamType=\\"on-demand\\"\\n      playbackId=\\"c7Z2BbDa01FzD02FihqVnCoInr8X01XRigE\\"\\n      primaryColor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"\\n      secondaryColor=\\"#000000\\"\\n      accentColor=\\"#653CB0\\"\\n      autoPlay\\n      loop\\n      muted\\n  />\\n</div>\\nBefore sharing with others, thoroughly test your AR scene:\\n\\n1. **Visit the Location**: Go to the physical location where your scene is anchored\\n2. **Start Recording**: Use your device\'s built-in screen recording\\n3. **Scan QR Code**: Use your phone\'s camera to scan the code\\n4. **Launch AR**: Follow the prompts to open the AR experience\\n5. **Orient Yourself**: Face the correct direction (typically west for my examples)\\n6. **Activate Scene**: Click the play button to begin the AR experience\\n7. **Toggle Visibility**: Use the eye icon to fade the historic scene in and out\\n\\n## Step 6: Prepare for Community Engagement\\n\\n### Print Materials\\n\\n- **QR Codes**: Print multiple copies of your QR codes\\n- **Map Integration**: Include codes on tour maps or information sheets\\n- **Instructions**: Provide simple step-by-step instructions for participants\\n\\n### Day-of-Event Tips\\n\\n- **Multiple Copies**: Bring plenty of printed QR codes\\n- **Backup Device**: Have a dedicated device ready to demonstrate\\n- **Quick Demo**: Practice a 20-second demo for hesitant participants\\n- **Troubleshooting**: Be prepared to help with QR code scanning issues\\n\\n## Real-World Results\\n\\nDuring my Green Density walking tour, I tested three historic locations:\\n\\n1. **Cesar Chavez (1931)** Showing early rails and paved surfaces over buried Precita Creek\\n2. **26th and Folsom (late 1800s)**: Revealing the original Precita Creek before it was buried\\n3. **Dolores Park**: Displaying the original marshland and watershed view toward the East Bay\\n\\nThe experience was powerful - participants could literally see how San Francisco\'s landscape and housing density have evolved over time. Most people needed less than 20 seconds to see the full experience, making it perfect to illustrate a stop on a walking tour.\\n\\n### Try it Out!\\n\\nHere is a copy of the map that we used that included QR code mapped to the specific locations of the source images.\\n<br/><br/>\\nClick the map to enlarge. You can print it out and go to the physical locations if you\'re in San Francisco, or just scan the QR codes to see what the views look like. After scanning the QR and loading the page, when you press the play button the default orientation is assumed to be facing West.\\n\\n<a href=\\"https://kfarr.github.io/ar-tour-assets/source/QR Overlay - US Coast Survey 1859.jpg\\">\\n  <img\\n    src=\\"/images/2025-08-13/Downsized-QR Overlay - US Coast Survey 1859.jpeg\\n\\"\\n  />\\n</a>\\n\\n## Device Compatibility\\n\\n- **Android**: Works with modern devices using Chrome or Edge browsers that support WebXR\\n- **iOS**: Available through enhanced compatibility features for Pro subscribers, using [Variant Launch as a polyfill for iOS](https://launch.variant3d.com/).\\n\\n## Tips for Success\\n\\n- **Start Simple**: Begin with one location before scaling to multiple sites\\n- **Test Early**: Visit the location and test the AR experience before your event\\n- **Backup Plans**: Have printed photos as fallbacks if technology fails\\n- **Engage Participants**: Encourage people to share their reactions and discoveries\\n\\n## Wrapping Up\\n\\nCreating AR experiences with historic imagery opens up incredible opportunities for community engagement and education.

Whether you\'re starting from scratch or using a user-generated scene, make sure your layout captures the key elements of your street design vision.\\n\\n![Creating and editing a 3DStreet scene](./images/2025-07-10/step1.jpg)\\n\\nOnce you\'re satisfied with your scene composition, it\'s time to export it for AI enhancement.\\n\\n## Step 2: Export a Clean JPEG\\n\\nDownload a clean, high-resolution JPEG from your 3DStreet scene using the **share button**. This will serve as the foundation for our AI enhancement process.\\n<br/>\\n![Exporting JPEG from 3DStreet](./images/2025-07-10/step2.jpg)\\n<br/>\\n\\nCapture the scene from an angle that best showcases your street design, as this will be the basis for all subsequent enhancements. Make sure to turn off the 3DStreet Logo and the Scene Title (this is a Pro feature) to create a clean export.\\n\\n## Step 3: Import to Black Forest Labs for Photorealistic Enhancement\\n\\nNext, we\'ll import your screenshot into the [Black Forest Labs Playground](https://playground.bfl.ai/) to add photorealistic shading and lighting. This AI-powered tool will transform your basic 3D render into a more realistically shaded image.\\n\\n![Screenshot placeholder: Black Forest Labs interface - video timecode ~00:00:26](./images/2025-07-10/step3.jpg)\\n\\nUpload your JPEG and for the Flux Kontext [pro] Model to work its magic. You can use a basic prompt like \\"add photorealistic shading and lighting\\" or add more details for specific styling changes if desired.\\n\\nYou\'ll get a couple different example outputs to choose from, each with its own interpretation of how to make your scene more photorealistic.\\n\\n### Output Before & After Comparison\\n<img-comparison-slider>\\n  <img\\n    slot=\\"first\\"\\n    width=\\"100%\\"\\n    src=\\"/images/2025-07-10/suburban-before.jpg\\"\\n    alt=\\"3DStreet scene before AI enhancement\\"\\n  />\\n  <img\\n    slot=\\"second\\"\\n    width=\\"100%\\"\\n    src=\\"/images/2025-07-10/suburban-after.jpg\\"\\n    alt=\\"3DStreet scene after AI enhancement\\"\\n  />\\n</img-comparison-slider>\\n\\n## Step 4: Use the Fill Tool for Structural Changes\\n\\nAnother powerful feature from Black Forest Labs is the **Fill tool**, which allows you to modify specific parts of your scene. For example, you can change the structure of buildings to have something more realistic looking for suburban single-family homes.\\n\\nOnce you have a source image loaded from a previous enhancement, or directly from 3DStreet, and you\'re viewing it in full screen from the BFL Playground, click the three-dots in the lower-right-hand corner and then click \\"Fill\\".\\n![Click the Fill tool](./images/2025-07-10/step4a.jpg)\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\nIn Fill mode, click and drag to create a mask (or outlined area) to indicate the area in which you\'d like to replace with new imagery.\\n<br/>\\n\\n![Using Fill tool to modify buildings](./images/2025-07-10/step4b.jpg)\\n<br/>\\nThen, enter a prompt to automatically fill the area with whatever you desire, such as:\\n- Replacing generic buildings with more realistic architectural styles\\n- Add detailed facades and realistic building materials\\n- Modify landscaping and environmental elements\\n- Enhance street infrastructure with realistic details\\n\\nIn this example we used the prompt, \\"replace with suburban single family homes\\":\\n\\n![Replacing default buildings with generates homes](./images/2025-07-10/step4c.jpg)\\n\\n<br/>\\nNow we\'ve created a customized, high quality rendering ready for sharing with stakeholders.\\n\\n## Step 5: Create Animation with Google\'s Veo\\n\\nWe can take it one step further, by turning this enhanced static image into a dynamic animation! Take your photorealistic screenshot, right-click to download it, and load it into Google\'s Veo through [Google Labs Flow](https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow/).\\n\\nOpen up the Flow tool, choose \\"Frames to Video\\", then upload your enhanced image, then choose that image as the first frame, then enter a prompt such as \\"Animate this suburban street scene.\\"\\n\\n<br/>\\n![Google Veo interface](./images/2025-07-10/step5.jpg)\\n<br/>\\nThe system will take about a minute to generate your animation options.\\n\\n## Step 6: Choose Your Animation Style\\n\\nAfter processing, Google\'s Veo will show you a couple different animation options. Each will have its own interpretation of how to bring your street scene to life with:\\n- Subtle camera movements\\n- Environmental animations (trees swaying, etc.)\\n- Lighting changes\\n- Atmospheric effects\\n\\n![Google Veo interface](./images/2025-07-10/step5b.jpg)\\n\\nYou can choose which ones you like best, or sometimes you\'ll need to adjust your prompt slightly to get an output that perfectly matches your vision.\\n\\n## Tips for Success\\n\\n- **Start with a clear, well-composed 3DStreet scene** - The quality of your final animation depends heavily on your initial composition\\n- **Experiment with different prompts** - Small changes in your description can yield dramatically different results\\n- **Be patient with processing times** - AI rendering can take a few minutes, but the results are worth the wait\\n- **Save multiple versions** - Keep copies of your work at each stage in case you want to try different approaches\\n\\n## The Results\\n\\nAnd there you go! You\'ve successfully transformed a basic 3DStreet scene into a photorealistic, animated visualization that can effectively communicate your street design vision to stakeholders, community members, or anyone who needs to understand your proposed improvements.\\n\\nThis workflow opens up exciting possibilities for urban designers, planners, and advocates who want to create compelling visualizations without needing advanced 3D animation skills.\\n\\n### Video Tutorial\\nHere\'s a video version of this tutorial:\\n<iframe width=\\"700\\" height=\\"400\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7P1Oq7a0tDM?si=wGMOYa8_W6f_uzv9\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"},{"id":"/2025/05/29/10-prompts-to-try-with-the-new-ai-assistant","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/05/29/10-prompts-to-try-with-the-new-ai-assistant","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-29-10-prompts-to-try-with-the-new-ai-assistant.md","title":"10 Prompts to Supercharge Your Workflow with the New AI Assistant","description":"Maximize your productivity with these 10 powerful prompts for the 3DStreet AI Assistant.

To help you hit the ground running with this powerful new feature, we\'ve compiled a list of 10 essential prompts that showcase its capabilities and will help you optimize your design workflow right away.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Getting Started with AI Assistant Prompts\\n\\nFollowing our [recent announcement](/blog/2025/05/22/introducing-ai-assistant-beta-your-creative-partner-for-street-design) of the AI Assistant beta, we\'ve already seen users discovering creative ways to leverage this tool. These prompts range from simple shortcuts to complex design tasks \u2013 all made accessible through natural language commands.\\n\\nLet\'s dive into the top 10 prompts you should try today:\\n\\n## 1. Make a Street\\n\\nThe most fundamental prompt is also one of the most powerful. Simply click the \\"Create Street\\" button shortcut or type something like:\\n\\n```\\nCreate a street with two drive lanes, two sidewalks, and two bike lanes\\n```\\n\\nThis instantly generates the foundation of your scene, and you can easily modify these parameters before generation. It\'s the perfect way to kickstart any project without manually placing individual street elements.\\n\\n## 2. Take Snapshots\\n\\nDocumentation and presentation are crucial parts of the design process. With the \\"Take Snapshots\\" button shortcut, the AI Assistant will capture three views of your scene:\\n- Your current perspective view\\n- A bird\'s eye view from above\\n- A head-on view of your street\\n\\nThese images export directly as PNGs to your computer, making it effortless to share your vision or include in presentations.\\n\\n## 3. Generate Report\\n\\nNeed to communicate the impact and purpose of your design? The \\"Generate Report\\" button shortcut prompts a form where you can specify:\\n- Current conditions\\n- Problem statements\\n- Proposed solutions\\n\\nThe AI Assistant then creates a report and generates snapshots highlighting how your design addresses the specified challenges -\u2013 useful for stakeholder presentations or community engagement.\\n\\n## 4. Insert Objects\\n\\nPopulating your scene is simple with commands like:\\n\\n```\\nAdd three benches along the north sidewalk\\n```\\n\\n```\\nPlace more trucks on the street\\n```\\n\\nThe AI understands these requests but sometimes still requires manual placement adjustments. We\'re still learning how to improve its spatial understanding, so please use the thumbs up or down button on the response depending on how accurate the AI is.\\n\\n## 5. Rotate Elements\\n\\nFine-tuning your scene is easy with rotation commands:\\n\\n```\\nRotate the food truck 45 degrees clockwise\\n```\\n\\n```\\nTurn the bicycle rack to face the street\\n```\\n\\nThis is an alternative to manually adjusting rotation values in degrees.\\n\\n## 6. Generate Ideas\\n\\nThe AI Assistant isn\'t just for execution \u2013 it\'s an ideation partner too. Try prompts like:\\n\\n```\\nWhat elements could I add to make this street more pedestrian-friendly?\\n```\\n\\n```\\nSuggest ways to improve bicycle safety at this intersection\\n```\\n\\nThe assistant responds with context-aware suggestions based on urban design principles and your current scene.\\n\\n## 7. Clone Objects\\n\\nQuickly populate your scene with multiple similar elements:\\n\\n```\\nClone this car three times along the parking lane\\n```\\n\\n```\\nDuplicate this tree every 20 feet along the sidewalk\\n```\\n\\nThis dramatically speeds up the process of adding repeating elements like street trees, parking spots, or seating areas.\\n\\n## 8. Resize Objects\\n\\nAdjust dimensions easily with natural language:\\n\\n```\\nMake the sidewalk 50% wider\\n```\\n\\n```\\nResize the bike lane to 6 feet wide\\n```\\n\\nThis tool is particularly useful when adjusting street dimensions to meet specific standards or when testing different space allocations.\\n\\n## 9. Change Materials\\n\\nTransform the look and feel of your scene instantly:\\n\\n```\\nChange the road surface to concrete\\n```\\n\\n```\\nUpdate the bike lane material to green asphalt\\n```\\n\\nThis capability allows for quick material studies without navigating through material menus.\\n\\n## 10. Change Objects\\n\\nNeed to swap elements in your scene? Simply tell the AI what you want to replace and with what:\\n\\n```\\nReplace the sedan with a food truck\\n```\\n\\n```\\nChange the maple trees to palm trees\\n```\\n\\nThis flexibility makes iterating through design alternatives seamless and efficient.\\n\\n## Unlocking New Possibilities\\n\\nThese prompts are just the beginning of what\'s possible with the AI Assistant. As you become more familiar with its capabilities, you\'ll discover your own workflow shortcuts and command combinations that make street design faster and more intuitive than ever before.\\n\\nThe beauty of the AI Assistant is its ability to understand natural language, so don\'t be afraid to experiment with different phrasings and commands. The system is designed to interpret your intent, even if you don\'t use the exact wording shown in our examples.\\n\\n## Provide Feedback\\n\\n### New Built-in Feedback Mechanism\\n\\nSince the release of this feature we\'ve added a feedback mechanism to the AI Assistant. After a text and/or function call response, you can click the thumbs up or down button to rate the response.\\n\\n![Screenshot showing the 3DStreet AI Assistant interface with a sample prompt](./images/2025-05-29/ai-response-feedback-buttons.jpg)\\n\\nPressing either thumbs up or down will rate your conversation for review and will help us improve the AI Assistant over time.\\n\\n### Share your Discoveries\\n\\nHave you found an innovative way to use the AI Assistant? We\'d love to hear about it! Join our Discord community (link in the footer) and share your favorite prompts and workflows. Your insights could help fellow designers unlock even more potential from this powerful tool.\\n\\nFor more information on the AI Assistant, check out our [documentation](/docs/key-features/ai-assistant) and stay tuned for future updates as we continue to enhance this feature based on your feedback.\\n\\nHappy designing!"},{"id":"/2025/05/22/introducing-ai-assistant-beta-your-creative-partner-for-street-design","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/05/22/introducing-ai-assistant-beta-your-creative-partner-for-street-design","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-22-introducing-ai-assistant-beta-your-creative-partner-for-street-design.md","title":"Introducing AI Assistant Beta: Your Creative Partner for Street Design","description":"Experience the power of natural language commands to create, modify, and automate street designs in 3DStreet with our new AI Assistant.","date":"2025-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"product update","permalink":"/blog/tags/product-update"},{"inline":true,"label":"AI","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"street design","permalink":"/blog/tags/street-design"},{"inline":true,"label":"new features","permalink":"/blog/tags/new-features"},{"inline":true,"label":"beta","permalink":"/blog/tags/beta"}],"readingTime":6.015,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kieran Farr","title":"Creator of 3DStreet","url":"https://github.com/kfarr","imageURL":"./images/authors/kfarr.jpeg","key":"kfarr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Introducing AI Assistant Beta: Your Creative Partner for Street Design","description":"Experience the power of natural language commands to create, modify, and automate street designs in 3DStreet with our new AI Assistant.","authors":["kfarr"],"tags":["product update","AI","street design","new features","beta"],"image":"./images/2025-05-22/ai-assistant-example-prompt-create-a-street.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"10 Prompts to Supercharge Your Workflow with the New AI Assistant","permalink":"/blog/2025/05/29/10-prompts-to-try-with-the-new-ai-assistant"},"nextItem":{"title":"Transforming Street Design with Augmented Reality: Lessons from the Front Lines","permalink":"/blog/2025/04/01/joint-webinar-street-design-and-immersive-advocacy"}},"content":"Today we\'re excited to announce the beta release of the 3DStreet AI Assistant, a new way to create and modify street designs using simple natural language. Just describe the street scene you want to create, and watch as your vision comes to life \u2013 no complex 3D editing required.<a href=\\"#the-fine-print-beta-status-and-availability\\">*</a>\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n![Screenshot showing the 3DStreet AI Assistant interface with an example conversation](./images/2025-05-22/ai-assistant-example-prompt-create-a-street.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Empowering Everyone to Design Better Streets\\n\\nAt 3DStreet, our mission has always been to provide tools that empower anyone to rapidly prototype visions for improving our shared environment, starting with streets. The introduction of our AI Assistant marks a significant step toward making street design more accessible to everyone \u2013 from urban planning professionals to community advocates who may not be familiar with traditional 3D editing tools.\\n<br/> \\n<br/>\\n![](./images/2025-05-22/ai-assistant-first-message-panel.png\\n)\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\nWith the new AI Assistant, you can:\\n\\n- **Create complete street scenes** from scratch using natural language descriptions\\n- **Modify existing designs** by simply explaining what you want to change\\n- **Automate repetitive tasks** that would normally require multiple manual steps\\n- **Explore design alternatives** quickly without needing to master complex editing tools\\n\\n## How It Works\\n\\nUsing the AI Assistant is simple. Just click on the new \\"Assistant\\" icon at the bottom of the 3DStreet interface and start describing what you\'d like to create or modify. \\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n- \\"Create a two-way street with protected bike lanes and mature trees on both sides\\"\\n- \\"Add a mid-block crosswalk with a pedestrian refuge island\\"\\n- \\"Change the bike lanes to be at sidewalk level with planters as separation\\"\\n- \\"Add outdoor seating areas in front of the cafes on the north side\\"\\n\\nThe AI Assistant interprets your requests and performs the necessary operations to bring your descriptions to life, handling all the technical details behind the scenes.\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n![](./images/2025-05-22/ai-assistant-clone-example.jpeg)\\n\\n\\n## Why We Built This\\n\\nWe\'ve heard from many users \u2013 especially those new to 3D design tools \u2013 that while they have clear visions for better streets, translating those ideas into 3D visualizations can be challenging. Creating even simple scenes often requires learning multiple interface elements and performing several discrete actions.\\n\\nWhen we analyzed user behavior, we found it difficult to understand user intent through traditional analytics. Is someone moving around the scene because they\'re confused, happy with what they made, or looking for something specific? It\'s hard to tell.\\n\\nBy providing a natural language interface, we can:\\n\\n1. **Break down barriers** to entry for non-technical users\\n2. **Better understand user needs** through their natural language requests\\n3. **Provide an alternative UI** for operations that can be challenging or repetitive when using the existing interface\\n\\nPerhaps most importantly, it allows people to focus on the \\"what\\" of their street design rather than the \\"how\\" of the software.\\n\\n## Under the Hood\\n\\nThe 3DStreet AI Assistant is powered by Google\'s Gemini LLM via its Vertex AI API and our custom React-based chat interface. The most useful part of the Assistant is its ability to call tools that perform actions in the 3DStreet Editor. These tools include entity placement, entity updates, street segment creation and modification, camera control, geospatial location updates and project information memory. When a tool is called, the interface will display a yellow notification while pending and resolve into a green or red notification depending on the result of the function call. You can click the function call notification to see the details of the function call.\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n\\n![](./images/2025-05-22/ai-assistant-function-call-response-details.png)\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n\\nBuilding the AI Assistant has helped us improve the underlying 3DStreet codebase. By creating clear function calls for the AI to use, we\'ve had to improve our code structure and interfaces for a number of underlying features, especially street editing through our new [Managed Street Format](/docs/managed-street/overview-managed-street).\\n\\n## The Fine Print: Beta Status and Availability\\n\\n### Beta Status\\nThe AI Assistant is currently in beta testing, which means it\'s still evolving and may occasionally (often?) misinterpret requests or behave unexpectedly. During this early release period, the AI Assistant is available free of charge to all 3DStreet users with some caveats below.\\n\\nWe\'re actively collecting feedback to improve the experience and would love to hear about your interactions \u2013 both successful and challenging! Please share them in our Discord server or other social media (links at the bottom of this page).\\n\\n### Availability\\nDuring this early release period, the AI Assistant is available free of charge to all 3DStreet users, but you must have an account and be signed in. We reserve the right to set daily caps for free users if usage exceeds our budget limits. We reserve the right to log chat conversations to improve the AI Assistant and our street design tools. Access to this feature is subject to the terms of our [Terms of Service](/docs/about-3dstreet/terms-and-conditions).\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nWe\'re just getting started with AI integration in 3DStreet. Tell us what you\'d like to see as we continue to develop this feature! Some ideas we\'ve had so far include:\\n\\n- Better guidance for users wishing to create scenes from scratch, such as a Q&A flow for street geometry\\n- Support for more specialized street design elements\\n- Better leveraging of existing street data from geospatial sources to assist LLM with street geometry and placement of street elements\\n- Integration with local LLM APIs for users who prefer to run AI locally\\n- Expanded automation capabilities for professional workflows\\n\\n## FAQs\\n\\n#### Q: Is this a distraction from fixing other features?\\nA: Improved street geometry editing \u2013 especially better intersections support \u2013 continues to rank highly on our roadmap. Some users also share frustrations with elements of the 3DStreet user interface, especially new users. Providing simple interfaces for navigating and editing detailed scenes over a large 3D space is challenging. We hope the AI Assistant complements ongoing feature development by making existing features more accessible while we continue to develop more advanced capabilities. And sometimes developing UI for a new spatial feature is harder than developing the underlying code, making the AI Assistant a great option to introduce more experimental features.\\n\\n#### Q: Is this replacing the current editing interface?  \\nA: Not at all! The AI Assistant is an additional option that works alongside our traditional editing tools. Power users can continue using the full interface for precise control, while switching to the AI Assistant when it\'s more convenient.\\n\\n#### Q: What if the AI Assistant doesn\'t understand what I want?  \\nA: The technology is still evolving, and some requests may require clarification. You can always switch back to manual editing if needed. Your feedback helps us improve the system\'s comprehension over time.\\n\\n#### Q: Why did you choose the Gemini LLM model?  \\nA: We\'ve tested a few different models and found [`gemini-2.5-flash`](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/) to be the most effective for this use-case. Gemini appears to perform well with large context tasks, and our system prompt combined with a user\'s scene graph and other scene data elements can drive up context length quickly.\\n\\n## Try It Today\\n\\nThe AI Assistant beta is [available now in the 3DStreet app](https://3dstreet.app). Just look for the \\"Assistant\\" icon in the bottom of your screen to get started. We can\'t wait to see what you create!"},{"id":"/2025/04/01/joint-webinar-street-design-and-immersive-advocacy","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/04/01/joint-webinar-street-design-and-immersive-advocacy","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-01-joint-webinar-street-design-and-immersive-advocacy.md","title":"Transforming Street Design with Augmented Reality: Lessons from the Front Lines","description":"Learn how augmented reality (AR) is revolutionizing community engagement and accelerating urban planning projects.","date":"2025-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"AR","permalink":"/blog/tags/ar"},{"inline":true,"label":"visualization","permalink":"/blog/tags/visualization"},{"inline":true,"label":"urban planning","permalink":"/blog/tags/urban-planning"},{"inline":true,"label":"community-led planning","permalink":"/blog/tags/community-led-planning"},{"inline":true,"label":"community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"inline":true,"label":"geospatial","permalink":"/blog/tags/geospatial"}],"readingTime":4.81,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kieran Farr","title":"Creator of 3DStreet","url":"https://github.com/kfarr","imageURL":"./images/authors/kfarr.jpeg","key":"kfarr","page":null},{"name":"Nick Kaufmann","title":"Community Manager, InCitu","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nkauf/","imageURL":"./images/authors/nkauf.jpeg","key":"nkauf","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Transforming Street Design with Augmented Reality: Lessons from the Front Lines","description":"Learn how augmented reality (AR) is revolutionizing community engagement and accelerating urban planning projects.","authors":["kfarr","nkauf"],"tags":["AR","visualization","urban planning","community-led planning","community","geospatial"],"image":"./images/2025-04-01/webinar-banner-street-design-and-immersive-advocacy.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Introducing AI Assistant Beta: Your Creative Partner for Street Design","permalink":"/blog/2025/05/22/introducing-ai-assistant-beta-your-creative-partner-for-street-design"},"nextItem":{"title":"From Photos to 3D: Creating Custom Models with AI for Creative Street Scenes","permalink":"/blog/2025/02/06/creating-custom-models-with-ai-for-creative-street-scenes"}},"content":"#### How AR is revolutionizing community engagement and accelerating urban planning projects\\n\\n![A webinar banner image showing a perspective of an augmented reality overlay on top of a real-life picture of a street with promotional text for a webinar](./images/2025-04-01/webinar-banner-street-design-and-immersive-advocacy.jpg)\\n<br/>\\nThe future of urban planning is happening right on our streets.

When engineers present striping drawings or two-dimensional plans to community members, you can see the disconnect in people\'s eyes. Small business owners, residents, and stakeholders often can\'t visualize how proposed changes will impact their daily lives.\\n\\nThis information asymmetry between professionals and communities leads to predictable outcomes: projects lose political support, get watered down, face delays, or are canceled entirely.\\n\\n## Three AR Breakthroughs\\n\\n### 1. AR as a Rapid Prototyping Feedback Loop\\nThe game-changer isn\'t using AR to display finished designs\u2014it\'s using AR for **rapid iteration at the earliest stages**. Instead of spending significant time in AutoCAD before getting community feedback, planners can now create quick prototypes, test them on-site, and iterate based on real-world constraints.\\n\\n### 2. Converting Prototypes into Outreach Materials\\nOnce refined through iterative AR testing, those same prototypes become powerful communication assets and can serve as the foundation for detailed design work in traditional tools like AutoCAD.\\n\\n### 3. Democratizing Design: Anyone Can Do This\\nThese tools are accessible to both professionals and amateurs. Community advocates, planning staff, and engaged residents can all participate in the design process.\\n\\n## Real-World Case Studies\\n\\n### Valencia Street Bike Lane Reconfiguration\\nA community advocate organized visualizations for the conversion of Valencia Street from center-running to curbside bike lanes. \\n<br/>\\n![](./images/2025-04-01/valencia-street-flyover.jpg)\\n<br/>\\n\\nThe AR perspective the new configuration from the actual perspective of a crossing pedestrian was recorded to video to provide content for education and advocacy.\\n<br/>\\n\\n![](./images/2025-04-01/valencia-street-ar-ped-crossing.jpg)\\n\\n### Queens Boulevard Improvements\\n\\nA quick sample project created by Nick Kaufmann, a community manager at InCitu, to demonstrate how quickly he can create an example scene showing a sidewalk widening and protected cycle track improvement project.\\n\\n![](./images/2025-04-01/queens-blvd-ar-quick-iteration.jpg)\\n\\n### Buffalo Pedestrian Bridge\\nA pedestrian bridge connecting an underserved neighborhood to park amenities cut off by highways. The AR visualization told a dual story\u2014both the bridge architecture and the narrative of neighborhood reconnection. The project was completed in 2024.\\n\\n![](./images/2025-04-01/ralph-wilson-park-buffalo.jpg)\\n\\n### Columbus Bus Rapid Transit\\nCentral Ohio Transit Authority integrated AR into actual bus tours along proposed routes. The technology showed not just transit infrastructure, but walkable neighborhood development that transit investment could encourage. Officials used AR\'s people-occlusion feature for authentic social media content.\\n<br/>\\n\\n![](./images/2025-04-01/columbus-ohio-linkus-west-broad-brt.jpg)\\n\\n### The Hayes Promenade, San Francisco\\n\\nCommunity advocate Andrew Seigner with <a href=\\"https://www.hayespromenade.org/\\">Hayes Promenade</a> proposed converting a two-lane road with retail and parking into a single-direction lane with expanded pedestrian space. He \\"created an initial 2D design in Streetmix, imported it into 3DStreet, built it out in 3D space, and then use the AR Ready export option. This resulted in a complete augmented reality demo, where users can walk down our street with their phones, experiencing the proposal in first-person.\\"\\n\\n![](./images/2025-04-01/hayes-promenade-ar-feasibility-walkthrough.jpg)\\n\\n## Best Practices for AR Community Engagement\\n\\n### Make It a Group Experience\\nAR isn\'t about individual visualization\u2014it\'s about **unlocking conversations**. Successful implementations bring diverse groups together, often reaching stakeholders who wouldn\'t attend traditional civic meetings.\\n\\n### Meet People Where They Are\\nTake AR proposals to farmers markets, street festivals, and existing community events. Mobile AR\'s portability makes it possible to engage communities in familiar, comfortable settings.\\n\\n### Mix AR with Other Tools\\nThe most effective campaigns combine AR with traditional outreach methods, web-based 3D maps, and other communication tools. In Columbus, embedding AR into a real bus tour created an immersive \\"trip to the future\\" that made abstract planning concepts tangible.\\n\\n## The Emotional Power of Spatial Storytelling\\n\\nData alone doesn\'t change minds. When engaging with community members, statistics \\"roll off them like oil and water.\\" The response to change is often emotional\u2014people may intellectually understand that street safety is important, but they feel the loss of a parking space more acutely.\\n\\nAR\'s power lies in **turning fear of loss into collaborative opportunity**. Instead of focusing on what\'s being taken away, these tools help communities envision positive alternatives: \\"You may be losing a parking space, but here\'s what you gain\u2014and what would you like to gain?\\"\\n\\nWhen people can see five new restaurant tables or beneficial rain gardens that prevent flooding, they start thinking: \\"I have agency to decide what could be there.\\" This shift from loss aversion to collaborative visioning is where real change happens.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nBoth 3DStreet and InCitu offer free tiers for experimentation. The basic workflow is simple:\\n\\n1. **Create a scene** in 3DStreet with your target location\\n2. **Add and modify street elements** using drag-and-drop tools  \\n3. **Export as an `AR Ready` model**\\n4. **Import to InCitu** for location-based AR deployment\\n5. **Test and iterate** on-site, gathering community feedback\\n\\nThe most important insight from practitioners? **Start imperfect and iterate quickly**. The goal isn\'t award-winning renderings\u2014it\'s making spatial concepts tangible enough for meaningful community engagement.\\n\\nAs cities face mounting challenges around housing, climate change, and equity, tools that democratize urban design and accelerate community engagement aren\'t just nice to have\u2014they\'re essential for building sustainable, inclusive neighborhoods.\\n\\n## Webinar Recording\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2-fBPCSc3s0?si=nzjVg2YkGL9dIqsp\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Ready to experiment with AR for your next community engagement project?

Whether it\'s a unique piece of street furniture, a local landmark, or even a toy car, traditional 3D modeling can be time-consuming and requires specialized skills. But what if you could turn any object into a 3D model with just a couple of photos and some AI magic? Let\'s explore how to do exactly that!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Power of AI-Generated 3D Models\\n\\n![Screenshot of the TRELLIS interface showing the upload and generation process](./images/2025-02-06/trellis-ui-generated-before-extraction.jpg)\\n\\nUntil recently, creating custom 3D models required extensive knowledge of 3D modeling software and hours of work. Now, thanks to advances in AI technology, tools like Microsoft\'s TRELLIS can transform simple photographs into usable 3D models in minutes. This opens up exciting possibilities for urban designers, planners, and anyone interested in creating more imaginative and personalized street scenes.\\n\\n## Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your 3D Model\\n\\n### 1. Capture Your Reference Images\\n\\n![Two sample photos of an object from different angles, showing optimal photography setup](./images/2025-02-06/photo-grid-examples.webp)\\n\\nThe quality of your 3D model starts with good reference photos. Here\'s what you need:\\n- Take 1-2 clear photos of your object from different angles\\n- Ensure good lighting and contrast\\n- A neutral background works best\\n- Include both front and side views when possible\\n\\n### 2. Generate Your 3D Model with TRELLIS\\n\\nHead over to [TRELLIS on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JeffreyXiang/TRELLIS) to start the conversion process.\\n\\n![Example TRELLIS Hugging Face Spaces UI Steps for Conversion of Image to 3D Model](./images/2025-02-06/trellis-ui-steps-with-pink-lowrider.webp)\\n\\n1. Upload your reference photos -- make sure to click on the \\"Multiple Images\\" tab if you have more than one\\n2. Click \\"Generate\\" and wait for the AI to work its magic. Review the preview to ensure it captures your object well.\\n3. If the preview looks good, click \\"Extract GLB\\" to generate a GLB version of the model.\\n4. Click \\"Download GLB\\" to download your 3D model\\n\\nIf the first attempt doesn\'t look quite right, consider using more than 1 picture. Try for soft lighting instead of bright specular reflections and ensure the object is in focus and entirely in frame. \\n\\nYou can also try [Hunyuan3D-2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tencent/Hunyuan3D-2), which allows you to generate 3D models directly from text descriptions.\\n\\n### 3. Validate Your Model\\n\\nBefore proceeding, it\'s helpful to verify your model:\\n1. Visit [gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/)\\n2. Drag and drop your GLB file into the viewer\\n3. Confirm the model loads correctly and looks as expected\\n\\n### 4. Optimize for Web Use\\n\\n![Screenshot of OptimizeGLB.com interface showing compression settings](./images/2025-02-06/optimizeglb-ui-steps.webp)\\n\\nYour initial model might be larger than necessary. Here\'s how to optimize it using [OptimizeGLB.com](https://optimizeglb.com):\\n\\n1. Upload your GLB file. Enable Draco compression (but avoid mesh simplification)\\n2. Click \\"Process All Files\\"\\n3. Right-click the \\"Download\\" button, and\\n4. Click \\"Copy Link Address\\"\\n\\nThis step not only reduces file size but also gives you a hosted URL for your model.\\n\\n### 5. Import into 3DStreet\\n\\n![Screenshot showing the 3DStreet interface with the GLB import dialog](./images/2025-02-06/3dstreet-ui-add-glb-model.webp)\\n\\nFinally, let\'s bring your model into 3DStreet. Open the [3DStreet App](https://3dstreet.app/), and then:\\n\\n1. Click \\"Add Layer\\"\\n2. Choose the \\"Custom Layers\\" tab\\n3. Select \\"GLTF Model from URL\\"\\n4. Paste your OptimizeGLB link URL\\n5. Adjust scale, position and rotation as needed after adding to the scene\\n\\nSee our [documentation on importing custom 3D models](/docs/3dstreet-editor/custom-models-and-images) for more details on this step. A 3DStreet Pro plan is required to use this feature.\\n\\n## Tips for Success\\n\\n- Start with simple objects that have clear shapes and details\\n- Take photos in good lighting conditions\\n- Use the validation step to catch any issues early\\n- Consider the final size and scale in your street scene\\n- Keep backup copies of your original files\\n\\n## Share Your Creations!\\n\\nWe\'d love to see what you create with this workflow! Share your models and scenes with the 3DStreet community on our Discord channel or tag us on social media.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nThe intersection of AI and 3D modeling is evolving rapidly. Tools like TRELLIS are just the beginning, we\'re also seeing huge improvements in live style transfer to convert the low poly and low fidelity 3D tiles imagery into higher fidelity and more detailed 3D scenes.\\n\\nHere\'s an example of using live image to image style transfer with KREA.ai, a user-friendly AI generative creation and manipulation service.\\n\\n![A split image showing side by side of using AI-generated 3D models from TRELLIS in a 3DStreet scene (left) with image style transfer from Krea.ai (right)](./images/2025-02-06/krea-ai-vid-2-vid.webp)\\n\\nRemember, whether you\'re adding unique street furniture, local landmarks, or playful elements to your scenes, AI-powered 3D modeling can help bring your vision to life with unprecedented ease.\\n\\nWant to see this process in action?

The road serves multiple functions as it traverses urban, rural and regional landscapes, requiring careful design consideration to accommodate various user demands while maintaining principles of sustainability and connectivity.\\n\\nToday, this vital corridor operates as a two-lane arterial road accommodating a diverse mix of traffic:\\n* Motorcycles and tuk-tuks (bajaji)\\n* Private cars and vans\\n* Light and heavy commercial vehicles\\n* Public transportation buses\\n\\nWhile the current infrastructure technically supports both walking and cycling, it predominantly caters to motorized travel - creating challenges for sustainable urban mobility.\\n\\n<MuxPlayer\\n    streamType=\\"on-demand\\"\\n    playbackId=\\"svF02j01e7kpMEJuHGgHBMXxgT5kP01Bff01\\"\\n    primaryColor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"\\n    secondaryColor=\\"#000000\\"\\n    accentColor=\\"#653CB0\\"\\n    autoplay=\\"muted\\"\\n    loop\\n/><br/>\\n\\n## From Concept to Digital Twin\\n\\nOur team worked with key stakeholders including Tanzania National Roads Agency (TANROADS), Tanzania Rural and Urban Roads Agency (TARURA), Land Transport Regulatory Authority (LATRA) and Dodoma City Council (DCC) to explore treatments that would better support regional infrastructure needs.\\n\\nAs analysts entering the workforce, our background in civil engineering was very limited compared to some of our tenured colleagues and professional partners, making it challenging to convert traditional engineering drawings into visualizations that we could then leverage for our work with stakeholders. That\'s when we discovered 3DStreet, which allowed us to rapidly prototype different scenarios from the foundational engineering work of our professional staff and partners.\\n\\nUsing 3DStreet\'s prototyping capabilities, we created digital twins of both existing conditions and proposed changes:\\n* A six-lane dual carriageway with 2 dedicated public transport lanes for busses\\n* Two-lane service roads on both sides for local access\\n* Wide, shaded walkways and cycleways for non-motorized transport\\n* Integration with adjacent land use to support sustainable urban development\\n\\n<MuxPlayer\\n    streamType=\\"on-demand\\"\\n    playbackId=\\"J9CiVGx3w00021uejA201Fk7O8HwkFsZHmm\\"\\n    primaryColor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"\\n    secondaryColor=\\"#000000\\"\\n    accentColor=\\"#653CB0\\"\\n    autoplay=\\"muted\\"\\n    loop\\n/><br/>**The proposed design creates dedicated space for all modes while improving safety and connectivity.**\\n\\n## Bringing the Vision to Life\\nWe found the ability to instantly transform cross-sections designed in Streetmix to interactive 3D visualizations with satellite map layers in 3DStreet to be transformative to understanding the true impacts and benefits of the proposed project in context with the existing environment.\\n\\nAlso, using a combination of 3DStreet and Mapillary\u2019s street view imagery to create a before and after first-person perspective was particularly impactful - it helped both our team and our local partners understand how the proposed changes would affect the actual experience of using the street. Being able to visualize the separation between modes and the scale of proposed facilities made the benefits much more tangible.\\n\\nBy combining all the elements of 3D GIS data and Street elements from 3DStreet combined with the use of real-world ground truth from Mapillary imagery, we were able to create a very effective video visualization of the project background and potential future scenarios.\\n\\n<MuxPlayer\\n    streamType=\\"on-demand\\"\\n    playbackId=\\"V6wX5LBeLjY4otX01ILkXyVSmjL6HoqXK\\"\\n    primaryColor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"\\n    secondaryColor=\\"#000000\\"\\n    accentColor=\\"#653CB0\\"\\n    autoplay=\\"muted\\"\\n    loop\\n/><br/>\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\nAs our internship draws to a close, we\'re excited to see Dodoma continue its trajectory of growth aided by our World Bank colleagues investing in Tanzania\u2019s future.

While the island\'s current population numbers only a few thousand, it may soon need to accommodate more residents from Kiribati\u2019s other island which is increasingly vulnerable to rising sea levels.\\n\\n![Global and local map of Kiritimati Island](./images/2024-12-15/kiritimati-global-map.jpg)\\n\\n## Planning Ahead for Change\\n\\nThe island\'s main road network currently reflects its small population and historic development patterns. The existing infrastructure is basic, with limited provisions for pedestrians, cyclists, or public transport. As we look toward a future where Kiritimati could play a crucial role in regional climate migration, these roads will need to evolve to serve a larger, more diverse population.\\n\\n![Current road conditions from Mapillary](./images/2024-12-15/existing-conditions-kiritimati-london.jpg)\\n\\nThe current road infrastructure supports:\\n* Private vehicles, motorcycles, and cargo trucks\\n* Limited pedestrian movement\\n* Basic access to key facilities and settlements\\n* Connection between main population centers like London Town and Banana\\n\\n## From Reality to Digital Twin\\n\\nWorking with key stakeholders including local government authorities and the [International Road Assessment Program](https://irap.org/), the team explored design solutions that would create safer, more inclusive streets while preparing for potential population growth.\\n\\nUsing 3DStreet\'s visualization capabilities, we created digital twins of both current conditions and proposed improvements across three critical areas that represent the diverse needs of transportation infrastructure on the island.\\n\\n![Project areas of focus](./images/2024-12-15/local-aerial-map-kiritimati.jpg)\\n*Three areas of focus for the Kiritimati project*\\n\\n## Reimagining Street Space\\nProposed designs incorporate several key features to support sustainable mobility:\\n* Wider, shaded walkways to protect pedestrians from the tropical sun\\n* Slow speed zones in urban areas that safely mix vehicles, motorcycles, and bicycles\\n* Dedicated bus bays to support future public transport services\\n* Enhanced safety features based on iRAP assessment recommendations\\n\\n<MuxPlayer\\n    streamType=\\"on-demand\\"\\n    playbackId=\\"C1OeGSoJiPbALG5kJXnoQpy6oGEEvLz8\\"\\n    primaryColor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"\\n    secondaryColor=\\"#000000\\"\\n    accentColor=\\"#653CB0\\"\\n    autoplay=\\"muted\\"\\n    loop\\n/><br/>\\n\\n## Making the Case for Change\\nBy combining Mapillary\'s street-level imagery with 3DStreet\'s visualization tools, we were able to create compelling before-and-after comparisons that helped stakeholders understand the tangible benefits of the proposed changes. This approach was particularly valuable given the unique context of planning for both current needs and potential future scenarios.\\n\\nThe visualization process helped demonstrate how relatively modest infrastructure improvements could significantly enhance safety and accessibility while building climate resilience. These visualizations are proving instrumental in making the case for infrastructure funding that considers not just today\'s needs, but tomorrow\'s challenges.\\n\\n![Cross section](./images/2024-12-15/cross-section-kiritimati-alt-2.jpg)\\n\\n## Stretching the Capabilities of 3DStreet\\nThe Kiritimati project pushed our platform in exciting new directions. While 3DStreet was originally designed for visualizing individual street segments, the World Bank team\'s requirements encouraged us to significantly expand our capabilities. The project\'s scope required handling multiple kilometers of roadway across three distinct sections, driving us to optimize our rendering pipeline while maintaining detail.\\n\\nCreating locally appropriate assets and smooth fly-through animations that transition between current and proposed conditions required new approaches to both asset development and camera control. These technical challenges led to innovations in scene management and rendering that have since become standard features in our platform, benefiting visualization projects worldwide.\\n\\n## Looking Forward\\nAs climate change continues to impact Pacific island nations, the importance of forward-thinking infrastructure planning becomes increasingly critical. Through this project, we\'re demonstrating how digital twin technology can help communities like Kiritimati prepare for complex demographic and environmental changes while improving quality of life for current residents.\\n\\nThe visualizations we\'ve created are helping stakeholders understand how streets can be transformed from basic transport corridors into vibrant, safe spaces that support sustainable mobility for all users. As we continue to refine these designs, we\'re excited to see how this approach could serve as a model for other islands facing similar challenges across the Pacific region.\\n\\n## Read More\\n[Read the press release from International Road Assessment Program](https://irap.org/2024/12/kiritimati-island-concept-design-aims-for-4-star-safety/)\\n\\n*Disclaimer: The views expressed in this blog post do not necessarily reflect the views of the World Bank Group.*"},{"id":"/2024/10/25/announcing-open-street-map-and-3dstreet-integration","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/10/25/announcing-open-street-map-and-3dstreet-integration","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-25-announcing-open-street-map-and-3dstreet-integration.md","title":"Announcing Open Street Map for 3DStreet Integration","description":"Discover how 3DStreet is expanding its mapping capabilities with Open Street Map and GeoJSON integration, providing new options for areas without 3D tiles.","date":"2024-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"product update","permalink":"/blog/tags/product-update"},{"inline":true,"label":"open street map","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-street-map"},{"inline":true,"label":"geojson","permalink":"/blog/tags/geojson"},{"inline":true,"label":"mapping","permalink":"/blog/tags/mapping"},{"inline":true,"label":"open source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"}],"readingTime":2.87,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kieran Farr","title":"Creator of 3DStreet","url":"https://github.com/kfarr","imageURL":"./images/authors/kfarr.jpeg","key":"kfarr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Announcing Open Street Map for 3DStreet Integration","description":"Discover how 3DStreet is expanding its mapping capabilities with Open Street Map and GeoJSON integration, providing new options for areas without 3D tiles.","authors":["kfarr"],"tags":["product update","open street map","geojson","mapping","open source"],"image":"./images/2024-10-25/open-street-map-integration-sf-city-hall.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Visualizing Climate Resilient Infrastructure: Kiritimati\'s Sustainable Streets","permalink":"/blog/2024/12/15/visualizing-climate-resilient-infrastructure-kiritimati-sustainable-streets"},"nextItem":{"title":"New placemaking and street safety 3D models","permalink":"/blog/2024/10/04/new-placemaking-and-street-safety-3D-models"}},"content":"High resolution 3D map tiles have become a popular choice for adding immersive local context to 3DStreet scenes. However, sometimes the most interesting places on Earth have the least availability of detailed 3D map tiles -- such as large parts of Africa and South America. Even for locations with detailed 3D tiles coverage, we\'ve heard from users that sometimes the realism of the 3D tiles can distract from the focus of presenting proposed street projects.\\n\\nIn these cases, our new integration with Open Street Map (OSM) offers new dimensions to our mapping capabilities.\\n\\n# PICTURE HERE WITH SAN FRANCISCO CITY HALL\\n![Open Street Map Integration Screenshot of San Francisco City Hall](./images/2024-10-25/open-street-map-integration-sf-city-hall.jpg)\\n<b><i>A screenshot of the new 3DStreet OSM integration showing San Francisco City Hall.</i></b>\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Introducing Open Street Map Integration\\n\\n3DStreet now offers integration with Open Street Map (OSM) as a new Geospatial Layer map source. This integration provides 2D political map ground tiles and 2.5D buildings through OSM GeoJSON buildings data. This feature is now available for all Geospatial Pro Plan users in addition to the existing map data providers Google Maps 3D Tiles and Mapbox 2D Satellite Maps.\\n\\n![Open Street Map Integration](./images/2024-10-25/open-street-map-geospatial-layer-ui.jpg)\\n<b><i>Click Geospatial Layer > Map Source > osm3d to use the new OSM data source.</i></b>\\n\\n## The Advantage of Open Source Maps\\n\\nIntegrating OSM with 3DStreet continues our commitment to open-source collaboration. A key advantage of the OSM approach is that it allows you to leverage the existing OSM community and resources, ensuring that the data remains up-to-date and accessible to all. The 3DStreet integration today is \\"read only\\" and relies on existing OSM data, but [users wishing to update map data can do so through a variety of tools from the OSM ecosystem](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contribute_map_data).\\n\\n## More than just tiles - GeoJSON buildings\\n\\nIn addition to Open Street Map 2D ground tiles, the new OSM integration provides basic building geometry through GeoJSON OSM data sources. The basic building footprints provide just enough context in most cases for locals to understand the location of a proposed project, while not distracting from the focus on the proposed project itself.\\n\\nThis GeoJSON parser also opens the door to future integration of alternative geospatial data sources, although today this only supports closed polygons for buildings.\\n\\n## A-Frame Component for OSM Integration\\n\\nSimilar to our other integrations, we\'ve chosen to \\"build in the open\\" by contributing improvements to an existing A-Frame `OSM4VR` component designed by anonymous community member `ctrlw`.\\n\\nYou can view the original A-Frame component by *ctrlw* here [https://github.com/ctrlw/osm4vr](https://github.com/ctrlw/osm4vr) and [check out the 3DStreet version here](https://github.com/3dstreet/osm4vr) which adds webpack support to better handle dependencies as well as custom features to allow for integration with the 3DStreet Editor app. Like all parts of 3DStreet, we welcome community contributions to this component and others.\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nLooking ahead, we\'re excited about the potential to support custom tiles. In addition to the political map, we aim to move beyond this basic OSM implementation and support private servers and alternate tile types. Our ultimate goal is to allow users to specify which tile type they prefer, providing even greater flexibility and customization.\\n\\nStay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance 3DStreet\'s mapping capabilities and explore new ways to empower our users to reimagine public spaces.\\n\\nYou can help us shape the future of the 3DStreet OSM integration by providing your feedback through [email](mailto:team@3dstreet.com), [GitHub issues](https://github.com/3dstreet/3dstreet/issues), or our public Discord server (link in footer)."},{"id":"/2024/10/04/new-placemaking-and-street-safety-3D-models","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/10/04/new-placemaking-and-street-safety-3D-models","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-04-new-placemaking-and-street-safety-3D-models.md","title":"New placemaking and street safety 3D models","description":"Open-source 3D traffic safety device models as a result of a collaboration with the University of Oregon","date":"2024-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"product update","permalink":"/blog/tags/product-update"},{"inline":true,"label":"pedestrian","permalink":"/blog/tags/pedestrian"},{"inline":true,"label":"traffic calming","permalink":"/blog/tags/traffic-calming"},{"inline":true,"label":"open source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"inline":true,"label":"3d models","permalink":"/blog/tags/3-d-models"}],"readingTime":2.6,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Tyler Riedell","title":"Design Student, University of Oregon","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerriedell/","imageURL":"./images/authors/triedell.jpeg","key":"triedell","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"New placemaking and street safety 3D models","description":"Open-source 3D traffic safety device models as a result of a collaboration with the University of Oregon","authors":["triedell"],"tags":["product update","pedestrian","traffic calming","open source","3d models"],"image":"./images/2024-10-04/corner-island.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Announcing Open Street Map for 3DStreet Integration","permalink":"/blog/2024/10/25/announcing-open-street-map-and-3dstreet-integration"},"nextItem":{"title":"New Feature: Microsoft Login and Admin Setup Guide","permalink":"/blog/2024/09/02/microsoft-login-and-admin-setup"}},"content":"Hi, I\u2019m Tyler Riedell, a fourth-year product design student at the University of Oregon.

This experience has given me the opportunity to merge my passion for design with city planning and street safety, topics I never thought I\u2019d be involved in.\\n\\nThis whole experience has been transformative for me, especially in sharpening my 3D modeling skills. As a product designer, I\u2019m used to working with highly detailed models, often with enormous file sizes. But for the models I created to function on mobile AR platforms, I had to rewire how I approached 3D design. When Dr. Schlossberg initially told me to create models with the smallest polycount possible \u2014- without losing their identity \u2014- I was at a bit of a loss on where to begin.\\n\\nWorking with Dr. Schlossberg and team of graphics professionals from 3DStreet like Kieran Farr and GnanaSai Reddy pushed me to expand my knowledge of low-poly model design and the associated pipeline for preparing 3D assets for high performance real-time XR applications -- an area I knew little about before this project. I\u2019m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with such experienced individuals, and I\u2019m proud of how much I\u2019ve learned throughout the process.\\n\\n## Pictures and descriptions of 3D Models\\n![](./images/2024-10-04/traffic-calming-bumps.jpg)\\nTraffic calming bumps: This object is versatile and low profile, used traffic control, it is effective at alerting drivers of low speed areas ahead\\n\\n![](./images/2024-10-04/corner-island.jpg)\\nCorner island: This object was created in order to provide safer turns for cyclists in city intersections while still allowing a safe place for pedestrians to stand, it gives bikers full protection from cars throughout the entire bike lane\\n\\n![](./images/2024-10-04/parklet.jpg)\\nParklet: These objects are a great use of space for extra seating around restaurants, parks, and rest areas in cities\\n\\n![](./images/2024-10-04/picnic-bench.jpg)\\n![](./images/2024-10-04/usps-mailbox.jpg)\\n![](./images/2024-10-04/bin.jpg)\\n![](./images/2024-10-04/residential-mailbox.jpg)\\nPicnic table, USPS Mailbox, Bin, Residential Mailbox: Variations of these objects are common in nearly every city around the world, it seemed necessary to add them to the library of 3DStreet for added realism to city scenes\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nWorking alongside Dr. Schlossberg, Kieran Farr, and the team at 3DStreet has been an incredible experience, and I\u2019m truly grateful for the opportunity to learn from such talented professionals. As I look ahead, I\u2019m excited to embark on my next adventure in the design world\u2014ideally with a design consultancy in Portland, Oregon\u2014where I hope to collaborate with another group of creative, driven designers and continue growing both personally and professionally.\\n\\n## Use these traffic safety objects now!\\nUse these models now to create your own 3DStreet scene by launching the [3DStreet app](https://3dstreet.app/), then click `+` to add a new layer, and find these new models in both the `Sidewalk Props` and `Dividers & Traffic Control` categories."},{"id":"/2024/09/02/microsoft-login-and-admin-setup","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/09/02/microsoft-login-and-admin-setup","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-02-microsoft-login-and-admin-setup.md","title":"New Feature: Microsoft Login and Admin Setup Guide","description":"We\'re excited to announce the addition of Microsoft login to 3DStreet, along with a guide for administrators to enable 3DStreet for their organization.","date":"2024-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"product update","permalink":"/blog/tags/product-update"},{"inline":true,"label":"authentication","permalink":"/blog/tags/authentication"},{"inline":true,"label":"microsoft","permalink":"/blog/tags/microsoft"},{"inline":true,"label":"admin","permalink":"/blog/tags/admin"}],"readingTime":2.05,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kieran Farr","title":"Creator of 3DStreet","url":"https://github.com/kfarr","imageURL":"./images/authors/kfarr.jpeg","key":"kfarr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"New Feature: Microsoft Login and Admin Setup Guide","description":"We\'re excited to announce the addition of Microsoft login to 3DStreet, along with a guide for administrators to enable 3DStreet for their organization.","authors":["kfarr"],"tags":["product update","authentication","microsoft","admin"],"image":"./images/2024-09-02/editorial-sign-in-with-microsoft-buffer.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"New placemaking and street safety 3D models","permalink":"/blog/2024/10/04/new-placemaking-and-street-safety-3D-models"},"nextItem":{"title":"3DStreet Intersections Early Access","permalink":"/blog/2024/07/17/street-intersections-early-access"}},"content":"3DStreet now supports Microsoft login, making it easier for users with Microsoft accounts to access our platform.

So we decided to start with something simple: the goal for this initial component was to create a simple yet versatile interface for connecting multiple streets. The component includes options for adding curbs, sidewalks, crosswalks, stop signs, and traffic signals. We made this available in the 3DStreet API for other developers in June 2022, but it wasn\u2019t until now \u2013 2 years later \u2013 that the user interface and editor capabilities of 3DStreet have finally caught up to make this available for people to use without writing code.\\n\\nHere\u2019s a quick overview of the capabilities:\\n\\n## Create 4-way 90\xba intersections with custom sizing for each direction\\n![](./images/2024-07-17/lopsided-intersection.jpg)\\n<b><i>A custom intersection example with painted crosswalks along two sides of the long crossing distance, such as a mid-block crosswalk across an arterial where it meets an alleyway.</i></b>\\n\\n## Customization Features\\n* Supports optional dead-ends and t-intersections\\n* Supports optional traffic control devices: traffic signals, stop signs, or none\\n* Supports optional pedestrian features: crosswalks, sidewalks (for t/dead-end), or none\\n\\n![](./images/2024-07-17/custom-intersection.jpeg)\\n<b><i>An intersection example using nearly every feature.</i></b>\\n\\n## What\'s next for 3DStreet Intersections?\\nWe call this release Early Access for a reason -- 3DStreet Intersections need more work and we need your help to prioritize what needs improvement.

During the prototype process I was tasked with finding ways to visually represent pedestrian and micro-mobility improvements in AR and was pleased to have found 3DStreet and its rich library of urban planning prototype models.\\n\\nWhile 3DStreet\'s library of open-source urban 3D models was a great starting point, our project needed custom safety 3D models that were not available in 3DStreet to support Dr. Schlossberg\'s project goals. We partnered with the 3DStreet team on best-practices for low-polygon realtime 3D modeling on mobile devices with limited processing power for mobile Augmented Reality visualization. \\n\\nI created these models in Maya and worked with 3DStreet modeling expert [GnanaSai Reddy](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0121c5733ab653a5c6) for conversion to glTF (source) and glb (distribution) for use in the 3DStreet app and to empower future open-source community use and remixing. \\n\\n## Raised Crosswalk\\n![](./images/2024-07-15/raised-crosswalk.jpg)\\n`Dividers & Traffic Control: street-element-crosswalk-raised`\\n\\nRaised crosswalks reduce vehicle speeds and provide a safer environment for pedestrian crossing. The height of this 3d model allows users to see the elevated crosswalk clearly in Augmented Reality to understand the effect a raised crosswalk could have on an intersection or street crossing.\\n\\n## Traffic Circle\\n![](./images/2024-07-15/traffic-circle.jpg)\\n`Dividers & Traffic Control: street-element-traffic-island`\\n\\nThe traffic island, circle, or roundabout forces the flow of traffic to move in one direction. Focusing traffic to exit the roundabout from just one direction, instead of three, simplifies the pedestrian and driver visual environment and interaction. This object was created to be used for smaller residential or larger multi lane streets and can be scaled depending on the need.\\n\\n## Median Refuge Island\\n![](./images/2024-07-15/ped-median-refuge-island.jpeg)\\n`Dividers & Traffic Control: street-element-traffic-island-end-rounded`\\n\\nThe traffic islands were created to be used as a refuge island for crossings, providing a safe place for pedestrians to stand on a street while reducing their danger from vehicles. Visualizing a refuge island in AR allows users to see they have the same protection on the island as they would on a sidewalk.\\n\\n## Ped Crossing Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFB)\\n![](./images/2024-07-15/rrfb-midblock-raised.jpg)\\n`Dividers & Traffic Control: street-element-sign-warning-ped-rrfb`\\n\\nRectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFBs) are used as visual cues for drivers that pedestrians are crossing the road at a crosswalk. City planners utilize RRFBs regularly for crosswalks needing multilane crossings.

The toolbar is intended to help prevent \u201caccidental selection and moves\u201d where \u2013 during an attempt to move the camera view \u2013 a user unintentionally selects and moves an object. With no undo, this is a pain.\\n\\n![](./images/2024-06-25/baby-toolbar.jpg)\\n\\nThere are 3 toolbar options:\\n* Pointer - click to select and move an object\\n* Hand - a mode that prevents selection or moving objects, you can only click to move the view (press `shift` while clicking to rotate the view)\\n* New Object - clicking + will show the Add New Entity panel to add objects, smart layers, and more\\n\\nWhile we work on undo, using the Hand mode is the safest way to browse a scene without making unintended changes.\\n\\n## Many more improvements based on your project requirements and direct feedback:\\n\\n* No more remix - the concept of remix was confusing so we have removed it. Now you can simply \u201cSave\u201d or \u201cSave as\u2026\u201d \\n* Bigger scenes \u2013 we now support scene sizes up to about 3 miles / 5km. (Previously the skybox was too small, so we made it bigger.)\\n* Fixing bugs \u2013 sometimes 3d tiles wouldn\u2019t load so we fixed one of those cases, and sometimes the red and blue bounding box of your selected object was too large and didn\'t take into account rotation, so we fixed that too.\\n* New scene \u2013 Pro users now have \u201cNew Scene\u201d which allows you to start from scratch and create a new geolocated scene\\n* Simplification of rotation controls \u2013 when placing streets and objects most users appear to be rotating around the vertical \u2018y\u2019 axis. Therefore we updated the default rotation transform controls (accessed by pressing \u2018e\u2019 keyboard shortcut) to only allow rotation on that axis:\\n![](./images/2024-06-25/rotation-y-widget-trash-truck.jpg)\\n* If you get really excited about product release notes you can check out the full release notes here: https://github.com/3dstreet/3dstreet/releases/tag/0.5.1\\n\\n## New objects\\n\\nYou\u2019ve also suggested new 3D models as options to include in your projects.

From 2010-2020, it doubled its population by hosting many of SF\u2019s new residential building projects. [1] [2] Mission Bay is also host to well-known firms like OpenAI, Uber, and UCSF, not to mention world-class entertainment facilities like the newly built Chase Center, home of the Golden State Warriors.\\n\\nBut there\u2019s one glaring omission in Mission Bay \u2013 there are no schools. \u201cThere currently are no elementary, middle, or high schools, public or private, in the Mission Bay area,\u201d said Matt Haney in 2017, then President of the Board for SF public schools. \u201cThis is unacceptable. This is a community that urgently deserves and needs a school.\u201d [3]\\n\\n![](./images/2024-05-24/mission-bay-es-empty-site.jpg)<br/><i>\\nThe future site for an elementary school building in Mission Bay, San Francisco is currently a parking lot sitting on top of rocky fill covering what was once part of an actual bay and tidal wetlands. [4]</i>\\n\\n25 years after being proposed in a 1998 Mission Bay redevelopment plan, construction on a school in the neighborhood has finally begun! The $90 million Mission Bay Elementary School project is expected to be completed in time to open for the school year starting August 2025. [5]\\n\\n## New Neighborhood, Old School Transportation\\n\\nDespite its recent development, Mission Bay was designed with no protected active transportation facilities aside from bayside trails. Many of its streets consist of 3 lanes dedicated to motor vehicles in each direction (2 travel, 1 parking) with no separated bike lanes, few painted ones, and copious sharrows. While effective in accommodating egress vehicle traffic after Warriors and Giants games, existing street space does not promote active mobility for neighborhood residents and school children.\\n\\n![](./images/2024-05-24/mission-bay-es-nearby-intersection-large-roads.jpg)<br/>\\n<i>Owens Street meets Nelson Rising Lanes in Mission Bay, San Francisco. The parcel northeast of the intersection (currently occupied by a parking lot) is the future site of the proposed SFUSD Mission Bay Elementary School.</i>\\n\\nLocal community members are excited about the prospect of improving street conditions to encourage active walking, biking and mobility for students living in the neighborhood.\\n\\n\u201cMission Bay is a densely populated, flat neighborhood, so it just makes sense to provide active mobility options for students going to school. But we are faced with a built environment that prioritizes the car and makes walking and cycling a scary proposition for parents,\u201d said Peter Belden, a community activist and San Francisco\u2019s 2024 Bike Champion of the Year.\\n\\n## Community Groups Envision a Better Future Change\\n\\nHowever, community leaders were disappointed with the limited resources dedicated to improving street safety ahead of construction of the new school. While the City committed to fund a study [6] to identify problem areas and suggest possible designs for a few trouble spots, it fell short of community expectations by not delivering a comprehensive, neighborhood-wide plan for safe walking and biking access to the school.\\n\\nThe community took it upon themselves to create their own designs. \u201cWe started by rethinking the traffic circle neighboring the new school and originally designed to accommodate peak vehicle flows after ball games. With a school going in next door, we wanted to re-imagine it as best-in-class infrastructure that separates modes, providing a safety buffer for vulnerable road users while allowing residents to access nature and planned affordable housing without the need for a car,\u201d explained Nik Kaestner, the former Director of Sustainability at SFUSD.\\n\\n![](./images/2024-05-24/mission-bay-es-traffic-circle-hand-drawings.jpeg)<br/>\\nA hand-drawn sketch by Nik Kaestner to illustrate core concepts of a proposed project to add separated cycling facilities to an existing traffic circle at the intersection of Mission Bay Drive and Owens St.\\n\\n## From Idea to Prototype with 3DStreet Rapid Prototyping Service\\n\\n\u201cWe were inspired by \u2018Dutch-style\u2019 roundabouts [7] with full separation continuing through the intersection, not only along approaching streets,\u201d continued Kaestner. \u201cBut we were limited in our ability to convert our vision from hand-drawn sketches into a practical prototype that would excite fellow advocates and be taken seriously by City staff.\u201d\\n\\n<MuxPlayer\\n    streamType=\\"on-demand\\"\\n    playbackId=\\"wH4aMaxcBzafPSFA5a9n02YPLKy2GLzAD\\"\\n    primaryColor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"\\n    secondaryColor=\\"#000000\\"\\n    accentColor=\\"#653CB0\\"\\n    autoplay=\\"muted\\"\\n    loop\\n/><br/>\\n<i>Animation generated by 3DStreet showing the evolution from existing conditions of a mixed-mode traffic circle to a mode-separated traffic circle.</i>\\n\\nCommunity leaders turned to 3DStreet for help in converting the sketch into a 3D prototype that can be used  in advocacy and planning conversations with City staff and elected officials.\\n\\nThis simplified \u201cdigital twin\u201d encompasses a virtual representation of both the existing conditions and proposed future changes. Hosting on 3DStreet Cloud allowed the team to create visuals for specific use-cases on demand and share these with others to further remix.\\n\\n## Adding Context with Real World Elements\\n\\nTo provide visual context for stakeholders reviewing proposed changes, community leaders added real-world surface scan maps and a 3D model of the proposed elementary school using 3DStreet\u2019s Geospatial Pro features.\\n\\n![](./images/2024-05-24/mission-bay-traffic-circle-rev4.jpg)<br/>\\n<i>Adding the Mapbox satellite map ground layer along with a low fidelity 3D model of the school building helped ground the visualization in the present-day context.</i>\\n\\nLeveraging multiple camera perspectives, especially simulating a first-person view, was especially helpful to share critical design attributes with stakeholders.\\n\\n\u201cAs our neighborhood develops a vision for how we will welcome the Mission Bay school, this tool is a great gift to outreach and engagement with both elected officials and agency staff. The multi-viewpoint visualization, especially the first-person animation of traffic circle usage at a child\u2019s height and the before/after slider bar feature clearly convey what is possible.\u201d said Sarah Bertram, a local community member advocating on behalf of neighboring residents.\\n\\n<MuxPlayer\\n    streamType=\\"on-demand\\"\\n    playbackId=\\"GJ8AFx2PIwn9y5f2B016EVKXYkzmj6lxT\\"\\n    primaryColor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"\\n    secondaryColor=\\"#000000\\"\\n    accentColor=\\"#653CB0\\"\\n    autoplay=\\"muted\\"\\n    loop\\n/><br/>\\n<i>Animation generated by 3DStreet showing the first-person animation of traffic circle usage at a child\'s height.</i>\\n\\n## Is it Feasible? From 3D Prototypes to Civil Drawings\\n\\nThis project is just starting. The school has broken ground with more than a year of construction remaining. While the prototypes of safer school streets are winning people\u2019s hearts, the constraints of budget and technical feasibility are the next issues to tackle for community and City stakeholders.\\n\\nFortunately, 3DStreet gives stakeholders a head start as they consider more detailed civil plans. \u201c3DStreet\u2019s ability to export to other popular file formats allowed us to jumpstart the manual process of preparing baseline conditions so that our valuable engineer time can be better spent on project-specific requirements,\u201d said Jorge Romero-Lozano, a civil engineer and executive director of GreeningProjects.org, who also consulted on the project.\\n\\n## Make Your Next Community-Led Project a Success\\n\\nLet us help you with your next community-led improvement project.

Below is a summarization of the presentation to share our learnings from practitioners around the world experimenting with community-led design.\\n\\n<img src=\\"/assets/images/treat-fair-bollard-buddy-signage-960x0-877276f37f74e65e5f7a2a898de69fee.webp\\" alt=\\"Treat Fair Bollard Buddy Signage\\" />\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n## Community-Led Planning as Global Trend \\nOver the past 6 months I\'ve met hundreds of folks across the transportation and planning industry \u2013 from city planners and city and state transportation officials to local community activists, NGOs, private engineering consultants and many more.\\n\\nHundreds of meetings later, a clear trend has emerged from these conversations: The rising force of \\"Community-led Planning\\" \u2013 empowering local community members to envision and advocate for changes to their streets and public spaces. However, there are significant challenges preventing this from becoming mainstream practice.\\n\\n## The Challenge - Negative Trust Spiral\\nThe core issue, as articulated by practitioners worldwide, is that it\'s very difficult for most people to imagine changes to their streets. This leads to a negative feedback loop:\\n* Projects face pushback from the community because they don\'t understand the proposed changes\\n* This results in delays, watered-down designs, or even outright cancellations\\n* Trust erodes between the agency and community\\n\\n![](./images/2024-04-22/slide-challenge-negative-trust-spiral-current-conditions-street-planning-projects.jpg)\\n**Community engagement is often treated as a point-in-time exercise rather than a continuous process.**\\n\\nForward-thinking communities are trying to change this by making community feedback an integral, ongoing part of the planning process. Crucially, project ideas originate from the community itself, which then collaborates with the appropriate agency to refine the design to serve local needs.\\n\\n## Addressing Agency/Community Asymmetry \\nUnderlying this dynamic is a major knowledge asymmetry between transportation professionals and the general public when it comes to street design.\\n\\nTo enable meaningful community participation we need to level the playing field \u2013 to lift up community members from out of the informational asymmetry crevasse. One way to do this is through a simple, shared visual language to understand the geospatial relationships and design constraints of their streets. This is the key problem we\'re working to solve at 3DStreet, along with other industry partners [Streetmix.net](https://about.streetmix.net/), [inCitu](https://www.incitu.us/), [StreetPlan.net](https://streetplan.net/), and the [OSM Pedestrian Working Group](https://hackmd.io/legG6QzVREKTsiTSxUS2zA?view).\\n\\nThis emerging ecosystem of no/low cost tools allow anyone to quickly prototype street designs, transforming 2D diagrams into interactive 3D models. Early case studies show the power of this approach:\\n\\n* [In Manchester, CA, the city engineer used 3DStreet to clearly communicate parking tradeoffs for a Main Street redesign, a top concern for local businesses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycNIaqczyv0)\\n* [NGOs like Transport Oakland are training their members to create compelling visuals for advocacy using these tools on group workshop calls](https://studio.youtube.com/video/m393-ZNeU68/edit)\\n* [At a street fair in San Francisco, we enabled attendees to interactively place street furniture, plantings and amenities using just their smartphones to imagine a green \\"streets to parks\\" conversion](/blog/2024/03/25/dev-blog-geospatial-and-augmented-reality-feature-research#reaction-and-productization-1)\\n\\n![](./images/2024-04-22/slide-community-led-planning.jpg)\\n\\n## Accessible Tooling\\n\\nHistorically, 3D modeling, urban planning and civil engineering required expensive proprietary software. But with the consumerization of augmented reality and open-source tools like 3DStreet combined with widely-deployed WebXR and geospatial standards, these capabilities are now accessible to all. While much work remains to make them truly user-friendly, the potential to revolutionize community engagement is tremendous.\\n\\nBy equipping residents with the tools to express their vision, while educating them about real-world constraints, we can build trust, understanding and consensus between communities and transportation agencies. This is the promise of community-led planning \u2013 and it\'s a future we\'re excited to build together."},{"id":"/2024/03/25/dev-blog-geospatial-and-augmented-reality-feature-research","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/03/25/dev-blog-geospatial-and-augmented-reality-feature-research","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-25-dev-blog-geospatial-and-augmented-reality-feature-research.md","title":"Exploring New Geospatial and Augmented Reality Features for 3DStreet","description":"A developer update blog post on R&D during the first few months of 2024.","date":"2024-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"webxr","permalink":"/blog/tags/webxr"},{"inline":true,"label":"3dtiles","permalink":"/blog/tags/3-dtiles"},{"inline":true,"label":"google maps","permalink":"/blog/tags/google-maps"},{"inline":true,"label":"geospatial","permalink":"/blog/tags/geospatial"},{"inline":true,"label":"ar","permalink":"/blog/tags/ar"}],"readingTime":6.1,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kieran Farr","title":"Creator of 3DStreet","url":"https://github.com/kfarr","imageURL":"./images/authors/kfarr.jpeg","key":"kfarr","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Exploring New Geospatial and Augmented Reality Features for 3DStreet","description":"A developer update blog post on R&D during the first few months of 2024.","authors":"kfarr","tags":["webxr","3dtiles","google maps","geospatial","ar"],"image":"./images/2024-03-25/3d-tiles-3dstreet.jpeg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Community-led planning trends presented at the Caltrans Equity Advisory Committee","permalink":"/blog/2024/04/22/community-led-planning-trends-at-caltrans-equity-advisory-committee"},"nextItem":{"title":"Creating Augmented Reality Street Scenes with Streetmix, 3DStreet and Adobe Aero","permalink":"/blog/2024/01/30/creating-augmented-reality-ar-scenes-with-streetmix-3dstreet-adobe-aero"}},"content":"\\"Geospatial\\" is the uniting theme for the many feature requests we get from 3DStreet\'s growing user base. Users\xa0can already place custom street scenes, so it\'s natural to understand why geospatial features like 3D Google Map Tiles or Augmented Reality visualization keep coming up in conversations with users when we [explore common repeatable workflows for visualizing safer infrastructure](/blog/2024/01/30/creating-augmented-reality-ar-scenes-with-streetmix-3dstreet-adobe-aero).\\n\\nTo kick off 2024 we\'ve been doing some experiments to see how these technologies could be applied to public streets and spatial design.\\n\\n![](./images/2024-03-25/3d-tiles-3dstreet.jpeg)\\n**Proof of concept 3D Tiles and 3DStreet scene combined.**\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n## Google Maps 3D Tiles\\n\\nWe updated the New York Times R&D team\'s [GitHub repository for the OGC 3D Tiles A-Frame VR Component](https://github.com/nytimes/aframe-loader-3dtiles-component?tab=readme-ov-file#using-google-3d-tiles-api) to support loading 3D maps from Google Maps 3D Tiles. (Thanks Avner for doing the hard three.js work to make this happen.)\\n\\n### Why is this important?\\n\\nWhen presenting street improvements projects, leveraging the existing environment provides instantaneous context and understanding for stakeholders of all ages and abilities. Even low fidelity representations of the surrounding environment helps viewers recognize a project\'s location and orientation.\\n\\nThis experiment is a first step to adding 3D maps as a new feature to 3DStreet Editor.\\n\\n### Video Demo\\nThis video is a demo of what it could look like to localize your 3DStreet scene with 3D map tiles near Market and Van Ness Streets in San Francisco.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JRWd8P4QwTs?si=lAx7vGRB_rrVIqf6\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n### Reaction and productization\\n\\nThis demo resonated well with users -- [our first tweet sharing the concept](https://twitter.com/3dstreetapp/status/1768310079307272423) was retweeted 11 times and liked more than 50 times on Twitter and [attracted engaging comments on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/3dstreet_threejs-activity-7174079008819560449-kzqw).\\n\\nUsers would like 3D Map Tiles productized as a built-in feature of 3DStreet, but unfortunately the Google 3D Tiles API is significantly more expensive than traditional 2D map tiles starting at [$6 per 1000 unique user sessions](https://github.com/nytimes/aframe-loader-3dtiles-component?tab=readme-ov-file#using-google-3d-tiles-api). In order to offer this feature we will need to come up with a paid subscription plan option to cover the costs of Google Maps 3D Tiles access.\\n\\n## Bollard Buddy AR - mobile app for manual geolocation and object placement\\nThe recent [DreamXR hackathon](https://dreamxr.co/) in San Francisco was the perfect environment to work alongside other XR developers for inspiration to finish a new app in 48 hours. We created BOLLARD BUDDY AR -- an app that lets you place traffic control devices anywhere using augmented reality!\\n\\n### Video Demo\\nIt\'s easiest to show with a video:\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"315\\" height=\\"560\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mP32oAlz8iI\\" title=\\"Bollard Buddy AR - 2024 DreamXR Hackathon Demo\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"autoplay; encrypted-media;picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nThe app is simple:\\n* Press PLAY to start the AR view after scanning a QR code*\\n* Then tap to place cones or other objects at the yellow cursor.\\n* Choose between a few different traffic safety device models from the 3DStreet model library\\n\\nWhile cool, it is technically \\"table stakes\\" within the scope of AR app demos. But what\'s next makes it more useful.\\n\\n### Geospatial QR hack for fake VPS\\nWhat makes BOLLARD BUDDY AR app unique compared to other AR \\"tap to place\\" demos is the connection to a specific location -- a longitude and latitude is embedded in the app QR code so that any objects placed in the scene can be localized relative to that longitude and latitude origin point.\\n\\nThis is extremely effective as a cheap and easy way to have a perfect \\"virtual positioning system\\" (or VPS) as long as the person posting the sign is capable of posting the sign at the very specific longitude and latitude (and orientation) associated with the QR code. This is easier than it sounds -- by simply dropping a pin on Apple or Google Maps at a clearly identifiable landmark such as a parking meter or telephone pole at a sufficient zoom level you can get a very precise longitude and latitude.\\n\\n### Create and share from mobile -- serverless with no auth\\nThe other unique BOLLARD BUDDY AR feature is sharing your newly created augmented reality street scene with other users (and even yourself) to refer to in the future.\\n\\nOutside in the bright sun on the hot tarmac we don\'t want to challenge users with authentication or collecting data that requires keyboard input. How can we allow people to share a complicated geospatial scene without a server or authentication?\\n\\nOur trick was to stuff the newly created scene data in the URL as url-encoded data. More specifically, a JSON representation of the array of 3D A-Frame entities and for each their mixin, position, rotation properties are all [crushed](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/JSONCrush) and placed as a querystring value in a new \\"Share URL\\".\\n\\nThen we use the native OS share dialog to allow the user to choose how they want to share this, from copy/paste to sending message, email, AirDrop (my favorite) or more.\\n\\n### Challenges with web-based Augmented Reality\\n\\nI\'ve always been excited about the fun factor of AR and VR headsets, but recent technology advances in everyday smart phones means that the same tech is possible without a headset leveraging built-in AR libraries such as ARKit and ARCore on Apple and Android devices respectively.\\n\\nThe magic of these AR libraries is precision -- they have extremely accurate [simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) available out-of-the-box for native apps usable on almost any device you may have in your pocket.\\n\\nUntil now these libraries have only been available for native applications, but recently web JavaScript-based access was made available on Android through WebXR AR Mode bindings. iOS devices using Safari have not yet supported WebXR AR Mode, however recently there have been a few \\"polyfill\\" workarounds. We are using [Variant Launch](https://launch.variant3d.com/) which provides a (nearly) seamless experience for iOS users to instantly launch web-based AR apps. Behind the scenes, Variant Launch uses Apple\'s iOS \\"App Clips\\" feature to the underlying ARKit library through the WebXR JavaScript standard without needing to download an app first.\\n\\n### Reaction and productization\\n\\nPeople often show surprise when using the app for the first time -- perhaps from the fun of reconfiguring public space for the first time, or the magic of discovering a super power they didn\'t realize their smart phone supported.\\n\\nSome users see past the initial \\"Wow Moment\\" to practical use cases, especially for professional field measurement and planning for traffic control device placement or other civil engineering-related purpose. In fact, once users start placing basic cones provided in the default application it\'s not long before they start thinking of other objects they\'d like to place and additional use cases.\\n\\nWe\'ve continued development of this app concept, most recently adding new objects and improving usability and trying it out with real users at a street fair in San Francisco Saturday March 23.\\n\\n![](./images/2024-03-25/treat-fair-bollard-buddy-signage-960x0.webp)\\n**Picture of a street fair with QR code on signage to collect feedback from community members using a modified version of BOLLARD BUDDY AR with plants, flowers and other street greening objects. [Credit Benjamin Fanjoy/The Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/treat-avenue-green-space-19362364.php)**\\n\\nSimilar to other geospatial features, there are fees incurred to make AR placement apps available across all devices (especially including iOS).\\n\\n## Feedback and next steps\\nI\'d love to hear your feedback on this work at [kieran@3dstreet.org](mailto:kieran@3dstreet.org).

I\'m Marc Schlossberg, and I\'ve been working alongside [Danny Pimentel](https://journalism.uoregon.edu/directory/faculty-and-staff/all/pimend) and graduate student [Luke Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-walker-439b78119/) at the University of Oregon on an exciting project: crafting augmented reality (AR) landscapes for our streets. What I have here is a practical, step-by-step guide designed to walk you through how to bring this innovative vision to your own neighborhood. So, let\'s roll up our sleeves and get our hands digitally dirty!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Getting Started: Measuring and Designing\\n\\n![](./images/2024-01-30/lVthCNUM7YLUyBGXixqk-10.87.png)**First things first\u2014measure up!**\\n\\nTo kick things off, you need to know how wide your street is. This is more straightforward than it sounds: just pop over to Google Street View or use an aerial photo, and get an approximate measurement. It\'s okay if it\'s not pinpoint accurate \u2014 we just need a ballpark figure.\\n\\n**Crafting Your Street: Easy as Pie with Streetmix**\\n\\nOnce you\'ve got your measurements, it\'s time to jump onto Streetmix\u2014a free, user-friendly online tool that lets you reimagine that street space to your heart\'s content. Want to add bike lanes, benches, or green spaces? Simply drag and drop the elements you want to include, adjusting the widths to fit your street\u2019s dimensions. Here\u2019s where your creativity shines!\\n\\n![](./images/2024-01-30/J7eHGPI8MA57Pyzgsd8i-41.61.png)For my project, I took a standard residential street and turned it into a car-free park, a delightful haven for community gatherings. Imagine that \u2014 but on your block! Feel free to start with the street I made - Demo St.: https://streetmix.net/schlossb/20/demo-st\\n\\n## Viewing Your Creation: 3DStreet\'s Magic\\n\\n![](./images/2024-01-30/29P0QTWEp8JbvCQ8PeH3-63.32.png)\\n\\nWith your design all set in Streetmix, it\'s time to give it a touch of 3D flair. 3DStreet is a fantastic plugin that lets you visualize your newly designed street in all its three-dimensional glory. Explore your virtual environment, tweak and tune each element until you\u2019re satisfied. It\'s a mini-adventure in urban planning from the comfort of your screen! You can go straight to my Demo St. in 3DStreet as well: https://3dstreet.app/#https://streetmix.net/schlossb/20/demo-st\\n\\n**Trimming the Excess for AR**\\n\\n![](./images/2024-01-30/IkXMBseXhrpqImEJSANN-73.23.png)\\n\\nTo prep for AR, you\'ll want to peel away the layers that aren\u2019t needed\u2014like buildings, to keep things neat. After simplifying, you can then export your model directly into a format that\'s ready for the world of augmented reality.\\n\\nTo delete a layer, select the layer in the left-hand panel -- such as \\"Buildings & Blocks Container\\" in the screenshot above -- then press the `delete` key and click `ok`. This will remove buildings and grounds from lots that are not needed for our AR project.\\n\\n## Optional Tweaks: A Blender Bonus\\n\\n![](./images/2024-01-30/kmXnEg7FMoHUxW0GgLiu-95.91.png)For the enthusiasts out there who relish fine-tuning, the free software Blender is your playground. Here, you can manipulate your 3D model to perfection. However, remember this is purely optional\u2014the process is meant to be quick and streamlined.\\n\\n## Bringing It to Life: Augmented Reality Integration\\n\\nAlright, now to the magical part\u2014transferring your 3D model to an augmented reality software. I personally use [Adobe Aero](https://www.adobe.com/products/aero.html), thanks to the site license at the university, but there are other AR apps you can explore. This step allows you to add animations and make your scene come alive, although again, this step is not necessary for the \\"quick and dirty\\" path.\\n\\n![](./images/2024-01-30/tSVcvVL1kH92J4F4ALF8-112.94.png)\\n\\nAR software opens with an empty workspace and, at least in Aero, you can simply drag and drop your 3D file onto the workspace and the whole thing magically appears. In many ways it will look exactly like it did in 3DStreet.\\n\\n**Geolocation: Pinning It to the Real World**\\n\\n![](./images/2024-01-30/M5vycvy2ClFbSLnLm6FY-133.23.png)What\u2019s truly remarkable with software like Adobe Aero is the ability to anchor your AR scene to a precise location on Earth. While this grounds your creation to a specific spot, it\'s not mandatory; you can always opt to apply your scene freely to any street you wish.\\n\\n![](./images/2024-01-30/sZPPzIEDdoKCLolneDd8-145.05.png)\\n\\n## Sharing Your Vision: Universal Access\\n\\n![](./images/2024-01-30/KffxVJZ1prku9AeBBemu-158.27.png)\\n\\nOnce your AR scene is polished and ready, you create a shareable link through Adobe Aero. Anyone with this link can open it on their mobile device, head to the designated street, and behold\u2014your digital transformation materializes before their eyes.\\n\\n> \\"Your street is transformed into your scene that you can actually walk through and see what it would look like on your street, and you can go forward, backward, see all the different things that you\'ve done, and really start to reimagine, well, what would this street look like if it wasn\'t a street as has been, but is actually a park, a place for people in this particular example?\\"\\n\\n![](./images/2024-01-30/XP1Nfq1sugGz8zrILMJb-179.54.png)\\n\\n![](./images/2024-01-30/0ek0kL6ZzdbicjxigM67-181.43.png)\\n\\nTo illustrate, envision wandering through the park that was once just a plain street\u2014all through the magic of AR. Moving forward or backward, the entire scene is interactive and truly a game-changer for community engagement and urban design.\\n\\n## Wrapping It Up\\n\\n![](./images/2024-01-30/SjGd11l5Keu216ORRZav-189.75.png)\\n\\nAnd there you have it\u2014a dynamic overview of transforming streets with AR using some clever tools and a pinch of imagination.

[Zade Agency](https://zade.agency/) fits in the latter category as a software development team for-hire based in Ukraine. Over the past year Zade emerged as a major boost to our development productivity and I wanted to share how their contributions have helped 3DStreet in a critical time for the organization.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### The Challenge for 3DStreet\\n\\nTo meet our timeline for a [public beta launch of 3DStreet Editor in 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnjtUW4J8uc), we faced several challenges. A primary concern was the gap in React expertise among our existing development team. While we are skilled in various aspects, existing React knowledge was crucial for implementing deep and rapid modifications to [3DStreet Editor](https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet-editor) which is a heavily modified version of the [A-Frame inspector](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector).\\n\\nAdditionally, as a [self-funded project](https://www.3dstreet.org/docs/about-3dstreet/3dstreet-llc-entity) we have very real budgetary constraints making it imperative to optimize every resource.\\n\\n### Zade\'s Solution to Boost React Development\\n\\nWe found Zade through a direct personal referral via our designer [Daria Dombrovska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daria-dombrovska-933902207/). Zade immediately brought a wealth of React knowledge through their team of both senior and junior engineers, filling the crucial skill gap in our team.\\n\\nAs a self-trained software developer myself, I worked directly with a senior engineer at the beginning to confirm our architectural approaches and details of our tech stack. I also worked with our account manager to agree on the use of [GitHub Projects, issues, and PRs](https://github.com/orgs/3DStreet/projects/5) to manage our working relationship.\\n\\nFor day-to-day tasks I create [GitHub issues](https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet-editor/issues/) that are prioritized in [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/3DStreet/projects/5) and tackled via a junior engineer who is mentored by the experienced staff. Even as a junior engineer, they have way more experience in React fundamentals than I do given my [rather myopic focus on A-Frame and three.js development](<https://twitter.com/search?q=%22aframevr%22%20(from%3Akfarr)&f=live>) over the past decade.\\n\\n### 2023 Highlight: Launching 3DStreet Cloud\\n\\nOne of the most notable achievements in 2023 was the [launch of 3DStreet Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnjtUW4J8uc), a React application using [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).\\n\\n3DStreet Cloud is the foundation of the growth engine of the [3DStreet Editor product](https://3dstreet.app/) -- it is the system that allows our users to collaborate on safe street designs and fulfill our core mission.\\n\\n### Zade: Empowering Startups with React Expertise\\n\\nNow it\'s time for the pitch, because the Zade team deserves it!\\n\\nAre you an early-stage startup founder needing flexible React development solutions?

I spent the entire day testing many different WebXR applications with a heavy focus on evaluating which user interaction elements will be relevant for developers.\\n\\nBelow are some notes intended for other 3DStreet code contributors to reference as we work on supporting new WebXR compatible devices.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Gaze works very well as a primary user input mechanism\\nGaze interaction *\\"just works\\"* for native applications in this headset, however it\'s a privacy nightmare as gaze movement can be use to fingerprint (identify) individuals for tracking purposes, so that information isn\'t even given to native application. \\n\\nTo enable gaze user interface while not exposing gaze to the application, apps need to provide \\"hot spots\\" or hints as to areas that can be hovered. [There is a great video guide on how to adapt 2D DOM CSS website for gaze highlight interaction](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10279/), but there\'s no clear equivalent to this CSS hinting that can be done in the WebXR \\"3D DOM\\" or 3D space. The need has been recognized however, [there is a new ticket opened in the WebXR `immersive-web` GitHub repository that I recently added to.](https://github.com/immersive-web/proposals/issues/86)\\n\\n## Hand tracking is the most accessible input, not controllers\\nImagine a world where WebXR experiences are 100% hands-free, where a simple ray from the wrist and a pitch of the hand can activate functions. This is not just a possibility but now a necessity -- going forward, all WebXR experiences must be accessible via hands first.\\n\\nWe should now regard hand tracking as the \\"lowest common denominator\\" of user input for headset experiences. Controllers will still offer higher precision, off-camera movement tracking, more button trigger inputs, etc. but they are no longer the most accessible \\"default\\" option.\\n\\n## Launching WebXR applications\\nGetting WebXR working on this device is cumbersome. WebXR must be activated by searching through multiple Safari flags (System Settings > Apps > Safari > Blah blah blah). Then, on the web page itself a user must accept 2 separate approval popups when entering WebXR mode -- one for enabling immersive mode, the other for enabling hand tracking.\\n\\nIt may be possible to \\"pull\\" some advanced users into using WebXR on these devices with instruction on feature flag setting, but it will be impossible to use WebXR on this platform to \\"push\\" more people to your WebXR experience in its present form.\\n\\n## Space, Immersion and Passthrough with WebXR\\nIn WebXR mode on the device, a scene is rendered in _Full Space_ meaning no other application windows are present, unlike native apps that can choose to run in _Shared Space_ amongst other applications. An additional limitation is that the device does not currently support WebXR with _Passthrough_ mode, therefore you cannot run WebAR apps that make use of external cameras.\\n\\n*Therefore only your WebXR scene will appear in _Full Space_ immersion mode with no _Passthrough_.* This may be desirable for traditional VR applications but not as useful for next generation mixed reality applications.\\n\\nAn additional limitation is that WebXR Immersive mode is limited to a 1.5m radius from the user-specified origin, usually where the user was located when entering XR mode. Beyond this radius the immersive scene _Full Space_ begins fading into _Passthrough_ without the scene persisting. If a user continues moving away from the origin the will see a round Safari icon at the origin point, presumably indicating that the user has an open WebXR Safari session with an origin at that point.\\n\\n## Diorama vs. Full Room Scale\\nThe [visionOS developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/) is excellent and signals clear directions for the market.\\n\\nThe Diorama appears to be major application interface concept, [featured as a sample application](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/diorama) and a prime example of output from the new Reality Composer Pro authoring tool.\\n\\nThis is a useful concept to adopt with 3DStreet. With 3DStreet there are cases for both Diorama and Full Scale modes: some users may wish to view a scene in Full Scale life-size to get an accurate viewpoint of dimension, while other users may wish to shrink a scene down to a Diorama view to easily manipulate a large scene from a smaller workspace.\\n\\n## Combining WebXR with native applications\\n* Native applications can ask for rights such as _Passthrough_ or _Shared Space_ that are not currently accessible via Safari WebXR. It is definitely worth exploring the use of an embedded webkit-based webview in a visionOS application which may expand the ability for WebXR application to offer augmented reality experiences with a native-like experience.\\n* Reality Composer Pro looks like a powerful tool for non-developers. It is worth exploring a pipeline of 3DStreet > Reality Composer Pro > App Publishing. Therefore it is likely worth exploring tools to convert glTF exporting to USDZ format, or directly exporting the three.js / A-Frame scene into USDZ format.\\n\\n## Summary\\n* WebXR appears to be purposefully limited on this device with a degraded user experience. Consider webview or another mechanism to adapt WebXR application into a native app.\\n* Hand tracking is now a minimum requirement for WebXR apps, controllers are optional.\\n* Gaze interface is very effective but needs standardization work to enable in WebXR mode."},{"id":"/2023/12/21/gaussian-splat-compositing-for-constructed-street-scenes","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/12/21/gaussian-splat-compositing-for-constructed-street-scenes","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-21-gaussian-splat-compositing-for-constructed-street-scenes.md","title":"Creating novel 3D scenes by compositing Gaussian splats with A-Frame and three.js","description":"We share research and progress on improving the visual appearance of compositing new scenes from multiple splats using depth buffer and selective splat discarding.","date":"2023-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"gaussian splats","permalink":"/blog/tags/gaussian-splats"},{"inline":true,"label":"splats","permalink":"/blog/tags/splats"},{"inline":true,"label":"photogrammetry","permalink":"/blog/tags/photogrammetry"}],"readingTime":6.345,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kieran Farr","title":"Creator of 3DStreet","url":"https://github.com/kfarr","imageURL":"./images/authors/kfarr.jpeg","key":"kfarr","page":null},{"name":"Arthur Mougin","title":"3DStreet Contributor, WebXR Developer","url":"https://github.com/arthurmougin","imageURL":"https://github.com/arthurmougin.png","key":"amougin","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Creating novel 3D scenes by compositing Gaussian splats with A-Frame and three.js","description":"We share research and progress on improving the visual appearance of compositing new scenes from multiple splats using depth buffer and selective splat discarding.","authors":["kfarr","amougin"],"tags":["gaussian splats","splats","photogrammetry"],"image":"./splat-blog/3dstreet-splat-compositing-demo.jpg","hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Impact on WebXR Application Design from New Mixed Reality Headsets","permalink":"/blog/2023/12/29/new-mixed-reality-devices-impact-on-webxr"}},"content":"3DStreet\'s mission is to empower anyone to visualize safer streets. A common request to support this mission is to bring in local real-life elements from your actual streets by scanning them into 3D objects. Until now, the best technology for doing this (photogrammetry to textured 3D polygons) resulted in huge file sizes, difficult to edit output files, and gooey visuals like melting trees or cars that you may see on Google Maps in 3D mode.\\n\\nEnter Gaussian Splatting -- earlier this year a groundbreaking photogrammetry and visualization technique called gaussian splatting was released as part of a [research paper published at SIGGRAPH 2023](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/). I believe splatting to be *[the best modern method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVv_IQKlafQ)* to allow everyday users like you and me to scan 3D objects with our phones and retain the fine detail of organic material especially [plants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lowscL9YIjM), [trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr7P8_z0PSk), flowers and other natural elements -- all things we\'d like to see more of in our streets! \\n\\n![Side by side picture of the same apple tree showing 3d mesh vs. gaussian splat photogrammetry techniques](./splat-blog/3d-mesh-vs-splat.jpg)\\n\\nThis is still an R&D project, not yet a supported built-in feature of 3DStreet. In this post we share research and progress on how we are improving the visual appearance of compositing new scenes from multiple splats using depth buffer and selective splat discarding in three.js and A-Frame, underlying 3D frameworks supporting 3DStreet.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n# A splatting explosion!\\nA slew of gaussian splat tools have come to market -- creation apps for 3D scanning with your phone ([Polycam](https://poly.cam/) and [Luma](https://lumalabs.ai/)) and viewers for every platform and device imaginable ([too many to list](https://github.com/tomiwaAdey/awesome-gaussian-splatting?tab=readme-ov-file#rendering-and-visualisation-tools)) and even [browser-based cropping and editing tools](https://playcanvas.com/super-splat).\\n\\nHowever, much of the existing gaussian splat research and development focuses on scenes with just one single large splat.\\n\\nWith 3DStreet we\'re exploring something new -- constructing brand new street scenes from bits and pieces of existing 3D splats.\\n\\n# The problem: multiple splats in three.js are Hard\\nIf we can draw one gaussian splat in our scene, why not more? Well it turns out it\'s Hard. Compositing wasn\u2019t supported yet by the existing three.js / A-Frame splat viewing libraries so it resulted in things just not good enough for people to use as a product, like this fire hydrant and tree being occluded by a flower box further away.\\n\\n![Picture of error in splat ordering resulting in distant objects incorrectly occluding closer objects](./splat-blog/splat-render-order-error.jpg)\\n\\nTo solve this problem, we collaborated with [Arthur Mougin, a WebXR and full stack developer](https://arthurmoug.in/) who was excited to tackle a new challenge. Here is his writeup on how we enabled proper splat sorting, concluded by some discussion on what is coming next.\\n\\n# Use depth buffer with `depthWrite:true`\\nAfter analyzing the shader and rendering pipeline of threejs, we identified first that we needed to have proper scene-level occlusion.\\n\\nAt the scene level, Splats are just classic opaque objects with a unique drawing method. That\u2019s great because we can take advantage of the depth buffer. It\u2019s a grayscale image that shaders use to know if their pixel below or above something that was already painted. By default, splats did not write into it, causing strange artifacts when the draw order does not match the depth order. Same thing for recursive occlusion. \\n\\nSo, we [added the ability to write the rendered splats to the depth buffer](https://github.com/3DStreet/aframe-gaussian-splatting/pull/1/commits/dfa56ea471749e4864bfdedfcdd9c7c4aac9a656) with `depthWrite:true`. Turning it on improved our occlusion issues drastically. \\n\\n![partial-splat-compositing-progress-occlusion-with-artifacts](./splat-blog/partial-splat-compositing-progress-occlusion-with-artifacts.jpg)\\n\\n# Fixing border and edge blending issues\\nSometimes the border is not completely clean, we also wanted a way to improve it. \\n\\nIt was done this time in the fragment shader, where discarding cause the pixel not to be drawn. [We compare there for each blob\u2019s pixel their opacity, and if it\u2019s lower than our limit, it\u2019s not rendered.](https://github.com/3DStreet/aframe-gaussian-splatting/pull/1/commits/00d11e42f41a2adea824008ad81283001192176a)\\n\\nThis limit, the discard filter, has no effect when set to 0, but help cleanup unnecessary blobs that could ruin a proper transition between two splats. As it applies to all splat\u2019s blobs, turning it on will impact the splats quality.\\n\\n![gaussian-splat-depth-write-true-false-comparison](./splat-blog/gaussian-splat-depth-write-true-false-comparison.jpg)\\n\\nUnfortunately there is a trade off between different methods. As you can see in this next example below. On the right is the test scene with the original A-Frame splatting component that does not respect occlusion. On the left uses depthWrite which properly sorts the occlusion of the tree, fire hydrant, and flower box, but also results in artifacts especially visible on the bottom of the flower box where it meets the sidewalk.\\n\\n![splat-compare-discard-filter-0-and-0.2](./splat-blog/splat-compare-discard-filter-0-and-0.2.jpg)\\n\\nAdjusting `discardFilter` gives you control to find the right value, however as you continue to increase the `discardFilter` value approaching 1 the splats start to develop holes in the substrate and appear to be further apart.  \\n\\n![splat-compare-discard-filter-0.1-and-0.3](./splat-blog/splat-compare-discard-filter-0.1-and-0.3.jpg)\\n\\nA partially effective mitigation for the artifacts is to tightly crop your splats using a tool like [SuperSplat from PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/super-splat).\\n\\n# Updating the `aframe-gaussian-splatting` repository\\nIn the past we have been contributing changes directly to the [original A-Frame Gaussian Splat library by quadjr](https://github.com/quadjr/aframe-gaussian-splatting), and [Arthur has suggested a PR with these changes](https://github.com/quadjr/aframe-gaussian-splatting/pull/25), but we wanted to publish this piece before those are able to merged so we have forked this repo in the 3DStreet GitHub organization for now.\\n\\n#### GitHub: https://github.com/3dstreet/aframe-gaussian-splatting\\n\\n#### Demo scene (move around with `WASD` keys): https://3dstreet.github.io/splat-playground/basic/compositing-demo.html\\n\\n#### Demo scene source (also uses cutout entity): https://github.com/3DStreet/splat-playground/blob/main/basic/compositing-demo.html \\n\\n# Combining rasterization methods to add splats to 3DStreet scenes\\nNow that we have support in the library for splat compositing, it\'s time to test what these look like in 3DStreet scenes.\\n\\nWe created a sample scene that loads a 3DStreet street scene with manually placed splat entities placed around the scene in appropriate locations. This was a first attempt to see how well the splats might fit in to a scene and what changes we need to make to 3DStreet Editor to support managing these with a user interface.\\n\\nThis picture shows a side-by-side view of the splat and low-poly mesh counterparts for the hybrid sedan and bus stop.\\n![3dstreet-splat-compositing-demo](./splat-blog/3dstreet-splat-compositing-demo.jpg)\\n\\nSince each of these splats are A-Frame entities, the 3DStreet Editor can provide a quick way to move them around and arrange a custom scene.\\n![3dstreet-editor-changing-scene-compositing-gaussian-splat](./splat-blog/3dstreet-editor-changing-scene-compositing-gaussian-splat.jpg)\\n\\n# Try it for yourself\\n\\nWe\'ve created a proof of concept demo showing splats that I have scanned around San Francisco, combined with polygon mesh models automatically created from 3DStreet.\\n\\n__Example scene (move around with `WASD` keys): https://github.com/3DStreet/splat-playground/__\\n\\n:::warning\\n\\nGaussian Splats in 3DStreet is a research project. Sometimes you need to reload once or twice for the splats to look better. If you\'re really adventurous press ctl + alt + i to access Editor but saving these scenes won\'t work and it will probably break. Be careful using this for real projects.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nDoes it work in WebXR? Yes, barely -- it requires a powerful device to maintain frame rate. Quest headsets and older phones have a hard time rendering this at full framerate.\\n\\n# What\'s next\\nThis is still a research technology. Even just in the past week there was a [whole new WegGL splat viewing library released by Luma AI](https://lumalabs.ai/luma-web-library) and more research on this topic seems to drop every week. Likely the method that we\'ve come up with will be replaced with a fancy new algorithm soon.\\n\\nWe\'ll keep iterating on the applications of this technology for street safety and more general urban design use cases. If this resonates with users we can explore how to make this accessible so that all users can create custom splat scenes with models they scan from their own streets.\\n\\n[Join our community to continue the conversation!](https://discord.gg/VN242sx9qu)\\n\\n# Video version of this post\\n<iframe width=\\"580\\" height=\\"420\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fy8PefDy5VY?si=pJ7F6j_mmmA2yo31\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"}]}}')}}]);
