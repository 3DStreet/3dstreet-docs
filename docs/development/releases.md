# Product Releases

## [3DStreet Core 0.4.5](https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet/releases/tag/0.4.5)
* Mostly hotfixes and bugfixes to [0.4.4](#3dstreet-core-044) such as fixing error saving scenes caused by default value of component properties not found; fixing display name of streets and segments by changing colon to bullet, therefore preventing interpretation of strings intended for display to user as being interpreted as attribute:value pairs. 
* Add animations for people on bicycles and some scooters
* Fix logo size for on overlay
* Fix disappearing helpers in "Share scene" window
* Fix bug of not-animated characters grouped at Z center

## [3DStreet Core 0.4.4](https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet/releases/tag/0.4.4)
* Completion of big [creator usability epic](https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet/issues/358)
* Significant visual improvements to environment (sky and lighting)
* Now choose from 8 different environment presets, each with a unique sky with matching lighting conditions impacting shadows, reflections and color tone: 'day', 'night', 'color', 'sunny-morning', 'cloudy-afternoon', 'sunny-afternoon', 'sunny-noon', 'foggy', 'cloudy'. Choose 'color' to specify your own background color.
* Upgrade A-Frame 1.5 to take advantage of new reflection component, global anisotropy setting for crisper paint striping and finer ground details, and help prepare for upcoming AR and hand tracking features
* new ocean
* shorter default street length 60m instead of 150m
* major refactor of creating 3d segments from json source: grounds underneath street segments and underneath buildings or lots, accurate x position and box widths instead of arcane x scale, using nicer display names for segments to make browsing in scene graph easier, fix elevation support
* randomize item placement, more, accurate rail widths (standard gauge and sf cablecar gauge)
