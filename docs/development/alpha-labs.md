# 3DStreet Alpha Labs

Check out some of our Alpha Labs features below -- these are features that are ready for testing and user feedback, but not ready for prime time. Try them out (with caution) and tell us how well they work and what we can do to make them better.

:::warning

Save a backup of your scene before trying these "Alpha Labs" experiments. 3DStreet is a [Beta product](https://www.3dstreet.org/docs/3dstreet-editor/saving-and-loading-scenes#beta-software) that may have bugs, and these Alpha Labs components are more likely to have bugs that could break your 3DStreet scene or prevent it from saving or loading.

## Resizing a street

1) Add a new street from Streetmix using the Pro layer menu
2) Select the parent layer of that new street
3) In the right-hand properties panel, scroll down to find the `Length` property. Change the value to your new street length (in meters) 
4) Click "synchronize" to see your settings change. (If synchronize is already true set to on, turn if off and on again)
