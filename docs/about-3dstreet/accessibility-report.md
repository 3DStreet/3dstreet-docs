## AA Standards Non-Compliant Element Mitigation Plan

The following list explains outstanding violations and remediation plans for each

### 1.2.5 Audio Description:
- Issue: Some user generated content may not contain sufficient audio description.
- Remediation: Our remediation plan for this issue is to include instruction to users to include audio description as part of their scene metadata.
### 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum):
- Issue: Some user interface elements may have varying contrasts depending upon user generated content in the background viewport.
- Remediation: Our remediation plan for this issue is to offer an accessibility option to make user interface elements opaque if in front of UGC.
### 1.4.10 Reflow:
- Issue: Some screen sizes may prevent all user interface fields, such as object property panel widgets, from being visible.
- Remediation: Our remediation plan for this issue is to add sufficient resizing and scrolling options to property panels to enable use of the application at varying screen dimensions.
### 2.4.7 Focus Visible:
- Issue: Some 3D placement interfaces in the viewport window may not show focus in a compliant manner.
- Remediation: Interfaces in the 3D viewport area should also be compliant by adding focus support.
