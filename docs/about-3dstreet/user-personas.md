# User Personas
We try to design 3DStreet to meet the needs of people aspiring to improve communities. To more easily plan for developing features to serve user needs, a common exercise is to formalize personas. These User Personas are imperfect and simplistic definitions, don't take them too seriously and feel free to suggest new ones.

### Creator
A creator makes content to share with others using 3DStreet. They may be importing a scene from Streetmix or generating one from scratch.

3DStreet “Creator” personas exist on a spectrum from everyday community advocates to professional civil engineers. Our primary Creator persona is an Advocate Creator who is passionate and motivated to improve their local community but may not have professional urban planning or civil engineering experience. A secondary Creator persona is a Professional Creator who has a strong background in urban planning and/or civil engineering.

### Viewer
A viewer consumes content created by 3DStreet. They may be viewing a scene in the app directly, or more likely watching a video or seeing an image generated by 3DStreet.

3DStreet “Viewer” personas exist on a spectrum from an everyday neighbor who lives near a proposed project, to a city staff member, or an elected official who may be asked to make decisions regarding the project. The Decisionmaker Viewer is 3DStreet’s secondary user persona (after Advocate Creators) whose professional role puts them in a position to approve, deny, change, or otherwise influence a proposed project.
