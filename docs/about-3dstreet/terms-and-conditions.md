Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.

Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

## "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer

The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.

Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.

## Use of Service Source Code

Some Service source code is made available under the AGPLv3 license. The AGPLv3 license is a strong "copyleft" license that requires any modified version of the software to be distributed under the same license terms, including when the software is run as a service over a network. This means that if you modify AGPLv3-licensed code and make it available to users over a network, you must also make your modifications publicly available under the AGPLv3 license.

The full license information for the primary Service repository can be found here: [LICENSE](https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to Your violation of these Terms and Conditions or Your use of the Service, including, but not limited to, Your User Content, any use of the Service's content, services, and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms and Conditions, or Your use of any information obtained from the Service.

## User Content
By using the Service, You may create, submit, or share content, including but not limited to text, images, designs, and other media ("User Content"). You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that You hold in Your User Content. However, by making Your User Content available on or through the Service, You grant the Company, as well as other users of the Service, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, create derivative works from, publicly display, and perform Your User Content.

### Public Nature of User Content
Please note that all User Content uploaded or created on the Service is public by default. Your User Content may be viewed and used by other users, and may be subject to remixing or modification, similar to content shared in open-source platforms like GitHub. All such User Content will be governed by a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY), which allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon Your work, provided they give appropriate credit to You.

### No Sale of User Content Without Consent
We do not sell Your User Content without your permission. The rights You grant through this license are provided to support the public sharing and creative collaboration that takes place within the Service. You acknowledge and agree that other users of the Service may use, modify, and distribute Your User Content, as long as they comply with the Creative Commons Attribution License terms.

### User Content Representations and Warranties
You represent that (i) any materials and content posted or otherwise submitted by you to the Service is original to you and that you have the right to grant us these rights, (ii) the posting and use of your materials and content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third-party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, rights of publicity, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights, and (iii) such posts and the content contained therein abide by these Terms of Use.

### Contribution of Source Code
Any source code contribution will be governed by the license terms stated on the Service's source code repository. We follow the GitHub Terms of Service for assigning your contributed code the same license as its respective repository, which may vary depending upon provenance and other factors. Those terms are pasted here for convenience, [here is a direct link to GitHub's terms](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license
).

> Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

> Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### Monitoring and Enforcement
We have the right, but not the obligation, to:
- Remove or refuse to post any User Content for any or no reason at our sole discretion
- Take any action with respect to any User Content that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion
- Disclose your identity or other information about you to any third party who claims that material posted by you violates their rights
- Take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Service

## Severability and Waiver
