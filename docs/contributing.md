Contributors to 3DStreet can come from various backgrounds, such as 3D artists, programmers, GIS experts, urban planners, and enthusiasts.

Some possible ways to become a contributor are:

* 3D modeling: If you're skilled in 3D modeling software (e.g., Blender, 3ds Max, Maya, SketchUp), you can create and contribute 3D models of buildings, street elements, or other urban objects. [See 3d modeling guide on `3dstreet-assets-source` README.](https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet-assets-source#readme)
* GIS and mapping: If you have experience with geographic information systems (GIS), you can help improve the geospatial accuracy and detail of the project by incorporating real-world map data or satellite imagery. We have 3dtiles and satellite map examples but they're broken at the moment sorry.
* Programming and development: Developers proficient in ðŸ§Šprogramming languages such as JavaScript, A-Frame, Three.js, React or more can help with the development and optimization of the software tools used in the project. See [a bare-bones contributing guide for core 3DStreet three.js and A-Frame](https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) or just [take a look at our outstanding "to-dos"](https://github.com/orgs/3DStreet/projects/5/views/4?filterQuery=status%3A%22To+Do%22) or [zoom out with our project board](https://github.com/orgs/3DStreet/projects/5)
* Documentation and tutorials: Writing documentation, creating tutorials, or making video guides can help newcomers learn how to contribute to the project and use the tools more effectively. You're reading the docs now. Peek behind the scenes with our open-source [docusaurus-based](https://docusaurus.io/) docs repo here: https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet-docs
* Testing and feedback: Test the existing models, tools, and workflows, and provide feedback to improve the project. [There are some tests](https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet/tree/main/test) but not so great coverage. Please feel free to file an issue, [the 3DStreet repo is the best to file new issues](https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet/issues/new).
* Community building: Engage with other contributors, help moderate forums, or organize events to promote the project and bring together people with shared interests. [Join our discord](https://discord.com/invite/VN242sx9qu), [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/3dstreetapp).

By contributing to projects like 3DStreet, you can help create realistic, open-source 3D environments that can be used in various applications, such as urban planning, architecture, simulations, or virtual reality experiences.
