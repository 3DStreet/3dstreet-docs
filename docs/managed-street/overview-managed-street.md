# Managed Street (Beta)

"Managed Street" is a 3DStreet system composed of a "Managed Street JSON" format, JavaScript A-Frame components, and custom user interface elements that allow end-users to create, convert, and add procedural elements on a street path.

# Using Managed Street

Users can create streets with the new Managed Street format using the 3DStreet Editor. Press the Add Layer button > Streets and Intersections tab > and scroll down to select a "(Beta) Managed Street..." card or drag-and-drop to a specific location in the viewport. These features are still in heavy development and are subject to change.

# Key elements

- [Street Segment Component](./component-street-segment.md)
- [Managed Street JSON Format](./managed-street-json-format.md)
