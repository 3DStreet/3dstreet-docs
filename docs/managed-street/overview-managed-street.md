# Overview

## Managed Street (Beta)

"Managed Street" is a new feature in 3DStreet that allows users to create and edit street scenes in a more efficient and streamlined way.

Under the hood, this feature is supported by a new "Managed Street JSON" format, JavaScript A-Frame components, and custom user interface elements that allow end-users to create, convert, add procedural elements on to a street path.

## Key elements

- [Managed Street Component](./component-managed-street.md)
- [Street Align Component](./street-align.md)
- [Street Ground Component](./street-ground.md)
