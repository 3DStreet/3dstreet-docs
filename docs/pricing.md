## Core Features Free for Non-Commercial Work
3DStreet.app software and 3DStreet Cloud service are free if you are manually positioning objects and/or streets imported from Streetmix.net or Streetplan.net and are using 3DStreet for personal, non-commercial use.

We encourage you to use this software to advocate for street safety improvements in your community.

## Geospatial & AR Features and Commercial Use
For geospatial features such as Premium 3D Map Tiles integration and Augmented Reality the price is $49/month per user.

If you are using 3DStreet and/or its creative assets for commercial purposes such as paid consulting, revenue generating video games, or other paid work for a client or official government use, we ask that you consider a commercial use license which is the same $49/month per user flat fee.

There is no annual commitment required -- a month is the minimum plan length. Feel free to activate and de-activate your plan as projects come and go. We accept credit cards, ACH, and check payments.

## Geospatial & commercial plan usage limits
* Up to 10,000 Premium 3D Map Tiles sessions per user per month. (These are cumulative, so 2 users = 20k sessions/mo, etc. Most users will not hit these limits unless projects are featured in widespread social media.)
* Unlimited QR Manual Anchor Codes for Augmented Reality features (iOS and Android web app)

Premium 3D Map Tiles are provided by third-party 3D map data providers such as Google, MapBox or other equivalent services. These are subject to change based on terms of those data providers which we cannot control.

## Rapid Prototyping Service
We've heard from users that despite the amazing automation features provided by 3DStreet, sometimes they don't have the time to create and modify intricate scene details to meet upcoming deadlines. [3DStreet offers a Rapid Prototyping Service to help you and your organization get started with scene creation services.](./services.md)
