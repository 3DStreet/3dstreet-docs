# 3DStreet Overview

Welcome to the 3DStreet documentation.

**3DStreet is an open-source web-based 3D platform to create and share highly detailed street scenes.** The 3DStreet organization is a mission-based project to provide more accessible street planning tools for users of diverse ages and abilities. [Learn more about the 3DStreet organization's mission here.](./about-3dstreet/overview-vision-mission.md)

**You can explore new scenes with 3DStreet Viewer or design new scenes with 3DStreet Editor.** A quick way to get started is to import a street from Streetmix and instantly generate a 3DStreet scene that you can modify and build from. [This step-by-step tutorial guides you through this process in 15 minutes or less.](/docs/getting-started)

**You can customize your street scene to match any configuration.** Use **3DStreet Editor** tools to modify, add, or clone objects to match an exisiting or future street configuration. [Check out the introductory Editor docs to learn the basic capabilities.](./3dstreet-editor/overview-3dstreet-editor)

**You can share your creation with others, or spice it up by importing into other apps.** Take instant snapshots to share on social media, or export your entire detailed scene to use in other 3D rendering apps.
