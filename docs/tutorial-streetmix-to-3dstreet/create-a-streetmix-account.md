# Creating a Streetmix Account

[**Streetmix**](https://streetmix.net) is a collaborative civic engagement platform for urban design that allows you to design, remix, and share your neighborhood street.

### Why do you need a Streetmix account? 
Currently 3DStreet does not operate independently, it requires you to load a file from Streetmix. In order for you to save a street in Streetmix, you must create an account to acquire a link for a saved street. (If you already have a Streetmix account, [continue to the next step](/docs/tutorial-streetmix-to-3dstreet/create-or-remix-a-street-in-streetmix).)

### How to create a Streetmix account
There are two ways to create a Streetmix account:
1. Enter your email which prompts a confirmation. From here check your email and follow instructions. 
or 
2. Sign in with your Google account.
