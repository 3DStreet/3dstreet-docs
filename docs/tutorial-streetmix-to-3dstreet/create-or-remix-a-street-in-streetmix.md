## What is remixing?

A Streetmix street is a cross-section visualization of a street. Remixing is the process of copying an existing street and making your own changes, or "remixing." Other users can save and send any other public Streetmix street to be remixed or altered to create a new draft of a street scene. 

## Quick tips on how to make a Streetmix street


### Toolbar palette

Use the toolbar to select components to add to your street like lanes, people, and objects.
