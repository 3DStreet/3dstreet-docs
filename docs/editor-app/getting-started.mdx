# Getting Started with 3DStreet Editor

Create and customize detailed 3D street scenes with our interactive editor.

## Quick Start

### Starting with Streetmix
This tutorial will guide you through the process of importing a [Streetmix.net](https://streetmix.net) street into 3DStreet Editor, creating a 3D perspective image of your street, modifying aspects of the scene, creating an account and logging in, saving and sharing scenes, exporting scenes, and a preview of geospatial features such as 3D map tiles.

3DStreet does not autosave, so after you're done click save or you'll lose this work. or you can Save as... to make a new copy and keep the old version around for later. Just remember to rename that new one.

## Starting from Scratch
You can also use 3DStreet to create a new street scene from scratch. Click the "+" button for Add New Entity, choose "Street Layers" group, and then click on any of the preset street configurations or drag-and-drop to place the street at a specific location in your scene.

### System Requirements
To use 3DStreet you will need a desktop web browser on a recent Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with high-speed Internet (at least 500 kilobytes per second). Unfortunately, mobile devices, tablets and low-power computing devices such as Google Chromebooks are not supported at this time.
