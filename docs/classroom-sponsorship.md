# K-12 Sponsorship Program  

Classroom Sponsorship Program: 3DStreet Subscriptions Support Free K–12 Access
At 3DStreet, we believe great design is more than lines, layers, and rendering, It’s about people.

That’s why we’re launching our newest initiative:
## Classroom Sponsorship Program
Starting today, for every __ individuals who upgrade to a premium 3DStreet plan will unlock free access for a K–12 classroom to use 3DStreet for one full year.
Whether you’re a professional planner, urbanist, student, or creative thinker, your upgrade helps bring design tools and civic imagination to young people across the country.

## Why Classrooms?
We’ve seen firsthand how powerful it is when students get the chance to engage with the built environment. Middle and high school students using 3DStreet have redesigned dangerous intersections, planned walkable school zones, and even reimagined downtowns in their hometowns.
But too many classrooms lack the resources—or the right digital tools—to bring those ideas to life. By pairing every premium sign-up with a sponsored school license, we’re helping close that gap.

## How It Works
When you upgrade to a premium account, 3DStreet will automatically donate a K–12 license to a school on our waiting list.


## Want to make it personal? You can nominate a specific school during checkout.


Each sponsored classroom receives:


Full access to the 3DStreet platform for up to ___ students


Teacher onboarding materials and curriculum ideas


The opportunity to feature student designs on the public 3DStreet map



## Small Action, Big Ripple
Your upgrade doesn’t just unlock advanced features for you—it empowers dozens of young people to start imagining and shaping their world.
When one designer steps forward, a whole classroom steps in.

## Meet the Future of Urban Design
This is about more than access. It’s about equity. It’s about nurturing a generation of diverse, curious thinkers who see their communities not just as they are, but as they could be.

## Ready to Make an Impact?
Upgrade today, and we’ll take care of the rest.
