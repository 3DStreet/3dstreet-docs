# K-12 Sponsorship Program  

Classroom Sponsorship Program: 3DStreet Subscriptions Support Free K–12 Access.

## Classroom Sponsorship Program
Starting today, for every five individuals who upgrade to a premium 3DStreet plan will unlock free access for a K–12 classroom to use 3DStreet for one full year.
Whether you’re a professional planner, urbanist, student, or creative thinker, your upgrade helps bring design tools and civic imagination to young people across the country.

## Why Classrooms?
3DStreet has proven to be a powerful classroom tool, helping to teach urban design in a foundational and accessible format.
But too many classrooms lack the resources—or the right digital tools—to bring those ideas to life. By pairing every premium sign-up with a sponsored school license, we’re helping close that gap.

## How It Works
When you upgrade to a premium account, 3DStreet will automatically donate a K–12 license to a school on our waiting list.

## How to Know if Your School Qualifies 
The School must be a K-12 primary or secondary school, universities are not eligible for this program. Public or private schools are welcomed to apply as long as you provide proper credentials. 

## Want to make it personal? You can nominate a specific school during checkout.


Each sponsored classroom receives:


Full access to the 3DStreet platform for up to 20 students


Teacher onboarding materials and curriculum ideas


The opportunity to feature student designs on the public 3DStreet map

## For Educators
Educators must be willing to participate in an onboarding call, as well as feedback calls. Be open to sharing your experience with 3DStreet and provide materials of how your students used the application in the classroom. 

## System Requirements
Each student will need acess to a computer or tablet with internet access and an updated internet browser such Safari or Chrome. For access to Augmented Reality features there must be access to a cellphone with data storage. Additionally, each account is required to log in with an email address so students must have a personal or school provided address. 

## Small Action, Big Ripple
Your upgrade doesn’t just unlock advanced features for you—it empowers dozens of young people to start imagining and shaping their world.
When one designer steps forward, a whole classroom steps in.

## Meet the Future of Urban Design
This is about more than access. It’s about equity. It’s about nurturing a generation of diverse, curious thinkers who see their communities not just as they are, but as they could be.
