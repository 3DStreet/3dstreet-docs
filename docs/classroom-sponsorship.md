# K-12 Classroom Sponsorship Program  

Empower the next generation of street designers. When you upgrade to a 3DStreet Pro plan, you unlock free access for a K-12 classroom to explore 3DStreet for one full year. Every five <b>Pro</b> plan upgrades sponsors one classroom — your commitment to better streets helps young minds reimagine their communities. Each <b>Super</b> plan upgrade unlocks an entire classroom.

## Why We Focus on Classrooms

Streets shape how we live, move, and connect. Teaching students to visualize and design better streets creates tomorrow's advocates for safer, greener communities. 3DStreet makes urban design concepts accessible to young learners, but many schools lack the resources to access these tools. Our sponsorship program bridges that gap, ensuring that creativity and civic imagination aren't limited by budget constraints.

## How It Works

Simple: upgrade to a 3DStreet Pro or Super plan, and we'll automatically provide a classroom license to a school from our waiting list. Want to make it personal? You can nominate a specific school — maybe your local school, your child's classroom, or a community you want to support. (5 Pro accounts support one classroom, and one Super account supports an entire classroom.)

## What Schools Receive

**Full 3DStreet Pro access for up to 30 students**, including:
- Complete access to 3DStreet design tools and 3D model library
- Use unlimited 3D Maps with Pro geospatial tools
- Augmented Reality (AR) scene sharing with Pro support for iOS and Android devices
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant to empower students to create by describing their intent using words
- All editing and visualization tools including import/export from Streetmix, Blender, and other creative tools.
- Teacher onboarding support and curriculum resources
- The opportunity to showcase student designs on our public gallery
- Opportunity to share your 3DStreet Pro experience with the community
- Up to 6 months access

## School Eligibility

We support any accredited K-12 primary and secondary school, public or private. Colleges and universities are not eligible for this program, but we have [affordable partnership options for higher education institutions](/contact). Schools need to provide credentials and have an educator willing to participate in brief onboarding and feedback sessions. We prioritize K-12 schools but summer programs or STEM camps serving similar age students are welcome to apply and we can include you when there is room.

## Technical Requirements

3DStreet is a web app, there is no software to install. Students will need access to:
- Computer or tablet with internet connection
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Email address for account creation and Pro feature access (personal or school-provided)
- For AR features: mobile device with camera and sufficient storage

## From Your Upgrade to Their Future

Your Pro upgrade does more than unlock advanced features — it gives students tools to envision their neighborhoods differently. When they design protected bike lanes, add street trees, or create safer crosswalks in 3DStreet, they're not just learning software. They're developing the vision to advocate for real change in their communities.
