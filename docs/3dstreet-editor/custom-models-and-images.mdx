# Adding Custom Models and Images to 3DStreet Scenes

## Importing 3D Models

3DStreet supports importing custom 3D models in glTF / GLB format to enhance your street scenes with unique objects and elements.

<MuxPlayer
    streamType="on-demand"
    playbackId="xf7ytm7VAP9QTLtyLL3Cs01Jul7rHHM26"
    primaryColor="#FFFFFF"
    secondaryColor="#000000"
    accentColor="#653CB0"
/>

### Prerequisites
* GLB format 3D model files
* Public URL access to your hosted models, usually via web hosting service (e.g., Glitch.com)

### Validation and Hosting

Before importing, double check that your file is compatible with three.js by validating your GLB file at [gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/). If your model is not compatible, you may need to convert it to a compatible format.

To host your file you will need a public URL to access it. You can use a web hosting service like Glitch.com to host your files:

* Create a [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) account
* Create a new project
* Upload your GLB file to the Assets section
* Copy the public URL for your model

### Adding Models to Your Scene

* In 3DStreet Editor, open or create a scene
* Click "Custom Layers"
* Select "GLTF model from URL"
* Paste your model's public URL
* Click OK to add the model

### Adjusting Your Model

Use the Properties panel to modify:
* Scale (adjust size on different axes)
* Position (move model within the scene)
* Rotation (orient model as needed)


## Importing Images

3DStreet allows you to import custom images to add signage, existing conditions photos, maps, and other visual elements to your scenes.

<MuxPlayer
    streamType="on-demand"
    playbackId="7eUdcuA6vIAJmdooxO02va1lzdd52HqES"
    primaryColor="#FFFFFF"
    secondaryColor="#000000"
    accentColor="#653CB0"
/>

### Prerequisites
* Image files in JPG, PNG, or WEBP format
* Public URL for your images, usually via a web hosting service (e.g., Glitch.com)


### Adding Images
Host your image:

* Upload to [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com) Assets
* Copy the public URL

In 3DStreet Editor:

* Click "Custom Layers"
* Select "Place New Image Entity"
* Paste your image URL
* Click OK

### Positioning and Adjusting

* Use Transform Controls for position
* Rotate images to face desired direction
* Adjust scale in Properties panel
* Consider mounting images on existing scene elements

### Best Practices

* Validate file formats before importing
* Scale elements appropriately for scene realism
* Position near relevant street features
* Use double-click to zoom for precise placement
