# Saving from 3DStreet Editor

Scenes can be saved while in **3DStreet Editor** for later use as either a PNG screenshot image or glTF file so they can be shared or used later.

### Capture screenshot as a PNG file
The quickest way to share your 3DStreet creation with others is to capture a screenshot. PNG image files can be shared on any social media, email or chat app.

To capture a screenshot with **3DStreet Editor** as a PNG file:
  - Click the purple camera button in the upper-right hand corner
  - Wait a moment
  - A PNG file of the current camera view is downloaded to your local downloads folder

### Save scene as a glTF file
glTF is a [standardized file format](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF#readme) for three dimensional scenes and models. glTF stands for Graphics Language Transmission Format.

Saving your scene as a glTF allows you to import your 3DStreet scene into other 3D software such as Blender, Unity, or Unreal to add photorealistic rendering and custom interactable elements.

To export a scene from **3DStreet Editor** as a glTF file:
  - In the right hand corner of Editor mode click the purple “Save” button
  - Once clicked it will show the “glTF model” option
  - Click and wait a moment for the file to download to your local downloads folder
  - The file will end in a `.glb` extension to indicate it is a binary glTF file that contains all scene data wrapped in one file
