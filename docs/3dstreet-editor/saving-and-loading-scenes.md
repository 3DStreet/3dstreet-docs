# Saving and Loading 3DStreet Scenes

## 3DStreet Cloud account

You can save and load scenes with a 3DStreet Cloud account. So that you don't have to create a new password, and so that we don't have to store it, we use a third-party provider Google Sign-in for account access.

## 3DStreet JSON files

You can also save and load scenes using 3DStreet JSON files. These are plain text files containing layers, entities and components that make up your street scene in JavaScript notation. This is the same JSON format used in 3DStreet Cloud but made available as a file that you can save and store locally.

## JSON file compatibility risk

3DStreet is in active development and changes frequently, and the 3DStreet JSON format is likely to also change over time as we continue improving the product. We do our best to version the JSON save/load format to provide backward compatibility, but it is likely that early versions of 3DStreet JSON Scene files will not be compatible with later versions. This means you might not be able to load old files with newer version of the application.

In using these features, you understand that you use this application at your own risk including your acceptance of the liability of potential data loss per the terms of the [License](https://github.com/3DStreet/3dstreet/blob/main/LICENSE) that we use to make 3DStreet available to you as an open-source product.
