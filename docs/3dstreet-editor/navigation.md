### 3DStreet Editor

#### Hand Icon

The hand icon allows you to click and drag to move around the scene without accidentally selecting an object.

Click and drag to move around the scene.

#### Zooming In and Out

With scroll wheel on your mouse move the wheel up and down. Or with trackpad use two fingers and move towards each other for a zoom in and move away from each other for zoom out.

#### Double Click
Double click on an entity in the scene graph or in the scene to fly the camera to that location.

:::tip
**Lost? Double Click:** If you get stuck or the camera gets lost in a strange position, try double clicking on an object to reset the camera. Double clicking an object is also a great way to quickly zoom into a specific area with more precision than using the scroll wheel.
<br/>
**Tell a Story:** Double clicking to zoom to an entity is a great tool for presentations with stakeholders -- focus attention on key project areas from any prior camera position in a live presentation, or use a screen capture tool to record video animations.

### Viewer
Like “Streetview” this is how you can get a real-life perspective of your street scene from the ground level

To move use arrows  / wasd or click once on a point on the ground and you will teleport to that location. Even fly around if you’re feeling adventurous.
