# Why 3DStreet?

## Problem Statement

Our team identified the following global safety issues affecting young people:
* Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5-29 years. [^1]
* In many cases, these injuries are to people outside the vehicle, which are preventable with proven infrastructure solutions installed in many locations across the world.
* However, access to the software and engineering skills required to design these solutions for implementation in specific locations are limited to very few people.

## Solution

Our solution is to create a suite of open-source software tools to be made accessible to users of diverse abilities, empowering them to design safer streets and transportation infrastructure. These tools should be interoperable, and need not all be made by our organization. 

We created 3DStreet to be part of this wider ecosystem. Specifically, we saw a lack of offerings for accessible street visualization and editing tools with 2D + 3D functionality.

We believe it is critical to have a healthy open-source street tool ecosystem that consists of many interoperable tools, such as Streetmix, A/B Street, 3DStreet, and hopefully more projects soon.

While there is some opportunity for traditional software licensing, we believe this is a limited commercial market since the users in most need have the least means. Therefore we believe these projects are primarily mission-based organizations that may have opportunities to become self-sustainable but should not be treated as traditional investment vehicles.

## Organization Purpose

3D Street is an open source virtual simulation platform for realistic map and satellite imagery of editable street map environments to visualize and share renderings at no cost to the user.

This platform has the capability to layer interfaces to be applied for various purposes and in its current state is an accessible tool used for city planning. This tool empowers municipalities and advocates to create a more democratized way to plan urban environments that are safe, equitable, and focused on healthier communities.

3DStreet was developed by a group of technologists concerned with the impact environmental planning, layout, and design can have on public health. It was designed to circumvent the reliance on cumbersome urban planning tools that involved extensive training and expensive licenses which prevented more people engaging in how their own cities and urban environments are designed.

3DStreet is quickly expanding and applying uses. As we update we will allow users to load previously created files from StreetMix into a 3D rendering, as well as save, share and edit those renderings to be used during planning meetings, community proposals, urban planning sessions, and design mock ups for municipal use in order to plan streets and transportation uses.

## Lack of Accessibility to Software Tooling
* Most street planning software is not accessible.
* Expensive, closed-source, motor vehicle bias, require professional degree or experience
## Software Tooling Mode Bias
* Examples: slip lanes default setting in intersection design;
