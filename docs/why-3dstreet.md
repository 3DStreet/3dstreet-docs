# Why 3DStreet?

## Organization Purpose

3D Street is an open source virtual simulation platform for realistic map and satellite imagery of editable street map environments to visualize and share renderings at no cost to the user.

This platform has the capability to layer interfaces to be applied for various purposes and in its current state is an accessible tool used for city planning. This tool empowers municipalities and advocates to create a more democratized way to plan urban environments that are safe, equitable, and focused on healthier communities.

3D Street was developed by a group of technologists concerned with the impact environmental planning, layout, and design can have on public health. It was designed to circumvent the reliance on cumbersome urban planning tools that involved extensive training and expensive licenses which prevented more people engaging in how their own cities and urban environments are designed.

3D Street is quickly expanding and applying uses. As we update we will allow users to load previously created files from StreetMix into a 3D rendering, as well as save, share and edit those renderings to be used during planning meetings, community proposals, urban planning sessions, and design mock ups for municipal use in order to plan streets and transportation uses.
