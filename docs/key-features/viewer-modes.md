- **[Camera Path Mode](#camera-path-mode)** - Automated camera movement along predefined paths (circle, forward, strafe, or custom) for presentations and consistent scene viewing

- **[AR Mode](#ar-mode)** - Augmented reality experience that places your street design in real-world environments using your device's camera

## Camera Path Mode

**Default viewing mode** that automatically moves the camera along predefined paths, perfect for presentations and consistent scene viewing. Viewers who experience your scene with this mode will not be able to adjust the camera position, it is moved for them.

### Available Path Types

#### Circle Path
Provides a smooth orbital view around your scenes origin point, ideal for showcasing the overall design and getting a comprehensive overview of your street layout.

#### Forward Path
Simulates walking or driving down the street, providing a realistic first-person view of what itâ€™s like to travel through your designed street. This mode is ideal for showcasing a more intimate, ground-level perspective of your design.
#### Strafe Path
Moves the camera side-to-side across the street, perfect for quickly demonstrating the width of your design and showing cross-sectional views of different street elements.

#### Custom Path
Allows you to define custom camera movement using the measure line feature in your scene. The camera follows the path you draw, giving you full control over the viewing experience.
