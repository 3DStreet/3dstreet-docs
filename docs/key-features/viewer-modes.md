# Viewer Modes

3DStreet now offers three different ways to experience and navigate your 3D street scenes. Each viewer mode provides a unique perspective and interaction style, allowing you to showcase your designs effectively and easily export custom videos to your desktop.

## Camera Path Mode

**Default viewing mode** that automatically moves the camera along predefined paths, perfect for presentations and consistent scene viewing. 

### Available Path Types

#### Circle Path
Provides a smooth orbital view around your scenes origin point, ideal for showcasing the overall design and getting a comprehensive overview of your street layout.

#### Forward Path
Simulates walking or driving down the street, providing a realistic first-person view of what itâ€™s like to travel through your designed street. This mode is ideal for showcasing a more intimate, ground-level perspective of your design.
#### Strafe Path
Moves the camera side-to-side across the street, perfect for quickly demonstrating the width of your design and showing cross-sectional views of different street elements.

#### Custom Path
Allows you to define custom camera movement using the measure line feature in your scene. The camera follows the path you draw, giving you full control over the viewing experience.

### How to Use Camera Path Mode

1. Camera Path mode is enabled by default when you view a scene
2. To switch between path types, use the viewer controls in the 3DStreet interface, which can be located by clicking on the viewer tab in the layers menu located on the left side of your screen. 
3. For custom paths, first create a measure line in your scene, then select it as your camera path. A measure line can be created using the ruler icon on the top of your screen. 

## Locomotion Mode

**Interactive navigation** that puts you in control of the camera, allowing you to explore your street design at your own pace. Ideal for live walkthroughs or demos of your scene. 

### Controls

- **Mouse**: Click and drag to look around and change your viewing direction
- **Click**: Teleport to specific locations in your scene

#### In VR
- **Physical Movement**: Walk around in your real space to move in the scene
- **Hand Controllers**: Use teleportation to move longer distances
- **Head Movement**: Natural head tracking for looking around

### When to Use Locomotion Mode

- Detailed inspection of specific street elements
- Interactive presentations where you want to control the viewing experience
- VR experiences where physical movement enhances immersion
- When you need to examine your design from multiple custom angles
