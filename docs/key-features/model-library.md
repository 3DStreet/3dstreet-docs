# 3D Model Library

3DStreet's comprehensive library includes over 200 accurately scaled 3D models for urban design, allowing you to quickly create detailed street scenes without any 3D modeling skills. The library is organized into intuitive categories to make finding the right elements for your project easy and efficient. Consistent and accurate scale, orientation, and positioning of our model library makes it possible to instantly drag-and-drop models into place without manual resizing and fine tuning.

## Using the Model Library

### Accessing Models

1. In the 3DStreet Editor, click the **Add New Layer** button (ðŸŒ³ðŸš¦ðŸš—) in the toolbar
2. Click a category such as **ðŸš¶ People** or **ðŸš— Vehicles** and browse the models with preview icons. Hover over models to preview their placement in your scene.
3. Click on a model to add it to your scene, or drag-and-drop it into your desired location

### Importing Custom Models and Images

Some specialized models are available exclusively to Pro subscribers, including:

* Advanced transit infrastructure
* Specialized tactical urbanism elements
* Certain building types
* Custom model options

### Best Practices

* **Shortcuts for Quick Placement**:
  * Use the duplicate feature (press `d` while an element is selected) for repetitive elements like trees or bollards
  * Use the grid overlay to maintain consistent spacing (press `g` to show grid)

* **Customization**:
  * Access model properties in the right-side panel after selecting a model
  * All models are accurately scaled to real-world dimensions, but you can modify them to achieve specific effects using the right-side scale panel
  * You can swap an existing model for another one in the right-hand panel by simply clicking the model dropdown and starting to type to search for a new model
