### 3DStreet Editor

#### Zooming In and Out

With scroll wheel on your mouse move the wheel up and down. Or with trackpad use two fingers and move towards each other for a zoom in and move away from each other for zoom out.

### Viewer
Like “Streetview” this is how you can get a real-life perspective of your street scene from the ground level

To move use arrows  / wasd or click once on a point on the ground and you will teleport to that location. Even fly around if you’re feeling adventurous - (requires holding left click as a way to move around. maybe change that to just point in a direction?)
