# Editing
3DStreet has powerful editing capabilities. You can move, rotate, and resize objects, as well as change their type and add advanced properties. You can also duplicate, add, and delete objects.

## Editing Object Properties
There are many properties you can edit for any object in the scene. Some properties can be edited through the toolbar, and some require you to edit the properties panel.

### Position and Rotation
You can move and rotate objects using the toolbar or the properties panel. 

#### **Using the Toolbar**
For position, click the **Move Tool** icon, then click and drag on the object to move it.

**Using the Arrows**

This is the recommended way to move objects. You can move an object in a particular direction by clicking a specific arrow and dragging it.

**Free Move**

This method allows for more range of movement but can be harder to control. Click and drag to move the object in any direction.
