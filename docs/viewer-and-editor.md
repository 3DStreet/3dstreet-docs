# Viewer and Editor

**3DStreet has two primary interface modes, and it is important to distinguish between them as they serve two distinct purposes.** 

### Viewer

The **3DStreet Viewer** is a read-only 3D view of a previously created street environment made with the 3DStreet Editor tool. 

- Enables users to view and navigate through a first-person "Street View" interface
- Allows users to move throughout the street environment
- Removes editing tool information to focus on visualization and limits distractions
- Supports immersive VR mode on WebXR compatible devices such as the Oculus Quest
- Allows loading of existing scenes and creating screen captures

### Editor

The **3DStreet Editor** is a tool that allows you to edit and modify components of a 3DStreet scene. With the Editor tool you can import designs from tools like Streetmix or create new original designs.

- Allows users to view street scene from multiple perspectives
- Loads scenes made previously in 3DStreet or import from Streetmix
- Select and unselect layers to inspect or edit position and other attributes
- Inspect and alter component properties with precise values using the property panel
- Export a glTF file for further editing and rendering in professional 3D applications
- Capture PNG screenshot of a the current viewport
