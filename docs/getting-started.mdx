# Getting Started with 3DStreet

## Starting with Streetmix
This tutorial will guide you through the process of importing a [Streetmix.net](https://streetmix.net) street into 3DStreet, creating a 3D perspective image of your street, modifying aspects of the scene, creating an account and logging in, saving and sharing scenes, exporting scenes, and a preview of geospatial features such as 3D map tiles.
<MuxPlayer
    streamType="on-demand"
    playbackId="TSxTjFBKoeTnspoQo02BFBPZXel6Pqtoo"
    primaryColor="#FFFFFF"
    secondaryColor="#000000"
    accentColor="#653CB0"
/>

## Starting from Scratch
You can also use 3DStreet to create a new street scene from scratch. Click the "+" button for Add New Entity, choose "Street Layers" group, and then click on any of the preset street configurations or drag-and-drop to place the street at a specific location in your scene. 

### System Requirements
To use 3DStreet you will need a desktop web browser on a recent Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with high-speed Internet (at least 500 kilobytes per second). Unfortunately, mobile devices, tablets and low-power computing devices such as Google Chromebooks are not supported at this time.
