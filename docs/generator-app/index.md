# Generator App Overview

The **3DStreet Generator App** is an AI-powered image generation and editing platform that enables you to create, modify, and enhance images using state-of-the-art machine learning models.

## What is the Generator App?

The Generator App provides three powerful AI capabilities:

1. **Text-to-Image Generation** - Create images from text descriptions
2. **Inpainting** - Edit specific areas of existing images by masking and regenerating
3. **Outpainting** - Expand images beyond their original boundaries

## Key Features

- **Multiple AI Models** - Choose from 5 different Flux models optimized for different use cases
- **Customizable Parameters** - Fine-tune generation with steps, guidance scale, seed, and safety settings
- **Interactive Editing** - Draw masks for precise inpainting control
- **Directional Expansion** - Outpaint in any direction (up, down, left, right)
- **Gallery Management** - Automatically save and browse all generated images with full metadata
- **Token-Based System** - Transparent usage tracking with flexible token purchasing

## Who is it For?

The Generator App is designed for:

- **Street designers** creating concept visualizations
- **Urban planners** generating streetscape mockups
- **Architects** exploring design variations
- **Anyone** interested in AI-powered image creation and editing
