# Using Streetmix
This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a street in Streetmix, importing it into 3DStreet, and then creating a 3D perspective image of your street that you can share with others.

To complete this tutorial you will need a desktop browser on a recent Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with a standard high-speed Internet connection, we recommend at least 500 kilobytes per second or higher. Unfortunately, mobile devices and low-power computing devices such as Google Chromebooks are not supported at this time.
