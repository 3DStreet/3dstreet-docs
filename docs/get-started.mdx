# Using Streetmix
Welcome to the tutorial "Use Streetmix to create a 3DStreet scene." This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a street in Streetmix, importing it into 3DStreet, and then creating a 3D perspective image of your street that you can share with others.

This tutorial takes most people at least 15 minutes to complete if you are getting started for the first time.

To complete this tutorial you will need a desktop browser on a recent Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with a standard high-speed Internet connection, we recommend at least 500 kilobytes per second or higher. Unfortunately, mobile devices and low-power computing devices such as Google Chromebooks are not supported at this time.
